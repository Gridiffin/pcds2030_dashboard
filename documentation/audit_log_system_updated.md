# Audit Log System

## Overview
The audit log system tracks user actions and system events across the PCDS 2030 Dashboard application. It provides a comprehensive trail of activities for security, compliance, and troubleshooting purposes.

## Recent Improvements
The audit log system has been enhanced with the following improvements:

1. **Fixed JSON Parsing Error**
   - Resolved the "unexpected character 'i'" issue in JSON responses
   - Implemented stricter output buffering control
   - Added fallback JSON parsing in JavaScript to handle malformed responses

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - Added detailed error logging with stack traces
   - Improved user feedback for errors
   - Added debugging information to help troubleshoot issues

3. **UI Improvements**
   - Added a refresh button for easier log updates
   - Enhanced filter options
   - Improved display of log details
   - Added export functionality with progress indicators

4. **Terminology Consistency**
   - Updated all references from "email" to "username" for consistency
   - Ensured consistent field naming across the codebase

## Key Files
1. `app/lib/audit_log.php` - Core audit log functions
2. `app/ajax/load_audit_logs.php` - AJAX handler for retrieving logs
3. `app/ajax/export_audit_logs.php` - AJAX handler for exporting logs
4. `app/views/admin/audit/audit_log.php` - Audit log display template
5. `assets/js/admin/audit-log.js` - Client-side audit log handling
6. `scripts/test_audit_log.php` - Test script for diagnostics

## Audit Log Functions
- `log_audit_action($action, $details, $status, $user_id)` - Records an action in the audit log
- `get_audit_logs($filters, $limit, $offset)` - Retrieves audit logs with filtering and pagination

## Troubleshooting
If issues occur with the audit log system:

1. Run the test script at `scripts/test_audit_log.php` to diagnose common problems
2. Check PHP error logs for detailed error messages
3. Inspect browser console for JavaScript errors
4. Verify database connectivity and table structure

## Performance Considerations
- The audit log now includes execution time tracking for performance monitoring
- Large exports are limited to 10,000 records to prevent server overload
- Pagination is implemented to manage large result sets efficiently

## Future Improvements
- Add more granular filtering options
- Implement audit log archiving for older entries
- Add visual analytics/dashboard for audit log data
- Implement real-time log streaming for monitoring
