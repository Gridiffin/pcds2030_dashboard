# Metrics to Outcomes Migration - Summary of Changes

## Phase 2 Implementation (May 17, 2025)

### Database Changes
- Created new tables with "outcomes" terminology:
  - `outcomes_details` (copy of metrics_details)
  - `sector_outcomes_data` (copy of sector_metrics_data)
- Created SQL migration script: `metrics_to_outcomes_migration.sql`
- Created rollback script: `metrics_to_outcomes_rollback.sql`
- Created validation script: `validate_migration.php`

### PHP Files Added
- Created new "outcomes" versions of core functionality:
  - `includes/agencies/outcomes.php`
  - `includes/admins/outcomes.php`

### PHP Files Modified
- Updated existing metrics files to use outcomes functionality:
  - `includes/agencies/metrics.php` (now a wrapper for outcomes.php)
  - `includes/admins/metrics.php` (now a wrapper for outcomes.php)

### API Endpoints Added
- Created new API endpoints for outcomes:
  - `api/check_outcome.php`
  - `api/get_outcome_data.php`
  - `api/save_outcome_json.php`

### API Endpoints Modified
- Updated existing API endpoints to use outcomes tables:
  - `api/check_metric.php`
  - `api/get_metric_data.php`
  - `api/save_metric_json.php`

### JavaScript Files Added
- Created new JavaScript files for outcomes functionality:
  - `assets/js/outcome-editor.js`
  - `assets/js/charts/outcomes-chart.js`

### JavaScript Files Modified
- Updated `assets/js/metric-editor.js` with compatibility layer
- Updated `assets/js/charts/metrics-chart.js` with compatibility layer

### Documentation
- Created migration documentation: `documentation/metrics_to_outcomes_migration.md`

## Next Steps

1. **Execute Database Migration**:
   - Run the `metrics_to_outcomes_migration.sql` script to create new tables
   - Run `validate_migration.php` to verify data consistency

2. **Testing**:
   - Test all create, read, update, and delete operations for outcomes
   - Verify charts and reports display correctly
   - Test submission workflows
   - Check admin and agency views

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Monitor application logs for errors
   - Track user feedback on any issues

4. **Future Cleanup**:
   - After a stable period (recommend 2-3 months), remove deprecated files and tables
   - Update any remaining references to "metrics" in the codebase

## Rollback Plan
If issues arise, use `metrics_to_outcomes_rollback.sql` to remove the new tables and revert to using only the original metrics tables.
