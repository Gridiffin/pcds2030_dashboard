# Period Filter Enhancement for Program Editing

## Overview
This document describes the changes made to improve the period filter functionality in the program editing feature. Previously, when a user selected a specific reporting period (e.g., Q1), the system would always display the latest submission record across all periods, causing confusion. Now, the system properly restricts edits to the selected period and displays only data from that period.

## Changes Implemented

### Backend Changes

1. **get_program_submission.php** (AJAX endpoint)
   - Modified to filter submissions strictly by the selected period_id
   - Removed fallback to previous submissions if no submission exists for the selected period
   - Returns empty/default form data if no submission exists for the selected period
   - Added explicit period_id to the returned data

2. **update_program.php**
   - Updated submission lookup to filter by period_id and get the latest submission for that specific period only
   - Added validation to ensure form submissions match the selected period
   - Updated finalization logic to use the selected period rather than only allowing the current period
   - Added period_id validation when processing form submissions

### Frontend Changes

1. **period_selector_edit.php**
   - Changed period selection behavior to reload the page when a period is changed (ensuring complete form refresh)
   - Added handling for submission_id hidden field updates
   - Updated event handling for period data loading

## How It Works Now

1. When a user selects a period from the dropdown, the page reloads with that period parameter
2. The system loads only submissions for that specific period, picking the latest one if multiple exist
3. The form displays data from the selected period only, or empty/default fields if no submission exists
4. When the user saves or submits data, it's saved specifically for the selected period
5. The user can switch between periods to view and edit submissions for each period independently

## Benefits

1. **Clarity**: Users can clearly see which period they are editing
2. **Data Integrity**: Updates are restricted to the selected period only
3. **Historical View**: Users can view submissions from past periods without inadvertently changing them
4. **Consistency**: The system behavior matches user expectations regarding period filtering
