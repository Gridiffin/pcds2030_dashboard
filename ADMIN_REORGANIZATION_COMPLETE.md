- `manage_outcomes.php` → `outcomes/manage_outcomes.php`

**Metrics (3 files):**
- `create_metric.php` → `metrics/create_metric.php`
- `edit_metric.php` → `metrics/edit_metric.php`
- `manage_metrics.php` → `metrics/manage_metrics.php`

**Programs (3 files):**
- `manage_programs.php` → `programs/manage_programs.php`
- `resubmit.php` → `programs/resubmit.php`
- `unsubmit.php` → `programs/unsubmit.php`

**Users (3 files):**
- `create_user.php` → `users/create_user.php`
- `edit_user.php` → `users/edit_user.php`
- `manage_users.php` → `users/manage_users.php`

**Other admin files:**
- `audit_log.php` → `audit/audit_log.php`
- `dashboard.php` → `dashboard/dashboard.php`
- `dashboard.php.bak` → `dashboard/dashboard.php.bak`
- `generate_reports.php` → `reports/generate_reports.php`
- `manage_periods.php` → `periods/manage_periods.php`
- `reporting_periods.php` → `periods/reporting_periods.php`
- `style-guide.php` → `style_guide/style-guide.php`
- `system_settings.php` → `settings/system_settings.php`

### 3. References Updated
- ✅ Navigation links in `app/views/layouts/admin_nav.php`
- ✅ Redirect paths in `login.php` and `index.php`
- ✅ JavaScript references in `period_selector.js`
- ✅ Documentation references updated
- ✅ All relative paths in moved files corrected (from `../../` to `../../../`)

### 4. Critical Bug Fixed
- ✅ **Dashboard.php Error Resolved**: Fixed incorrect require statements that were trying to load non-existent model files. Replaced with proper library includes:
  - Removed: `require_once` for User.php, Program.php, Metric.php, Outcome.php, Period.php, AuditLog.php (these models don't exist)
  - Added: `require_once PROJECT_ROOT_PATH . 'app/lib/admins/index.php'` (proper admin functions)

### 5. Verification Completed
- ✅ No PHP files remain in root admin directory
- ✅ All moved files pass error checking
- ✅ Key admin functions verified working:
  - Dashboard loads without errors
  - User management accessible
  - Reports generation accessible  
  - System settings accessible
- ✅ Navigation and redirects functioning properly

## Result
The admin views directory is now properly organized with a clear, logical structure that separates different functional areas into dedicated subdirectories. All files are working correctly and the reorganization is complete.
