## Quick Test Summary

### What was simplified:

1. **❌ Removed Complex Features:**
   - Quick preset buttons (Target, Achieved, Budget, etc.)
   - Keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+Shift+C, Ctrl+Shift+R)
   - Advanced table designer interface

2. **✅ Simple Interface Now Has:**
   - Text input field for column name
   - Dropdown for column type (Number, Currency, Percentage, Text)
   - Add button with plus icon
   - List of existing columns with remove buttons
   - Same for rows (Name, Type: Data/Calculated/Separator)

3. **✅ Fixed JavaScript Errors:**
   - `redeclaration of let TableStructureDesigner` - Fixed with conditional check
   - `Node.insertBefore: Child to insert before is not a child of this node` - Fixed by replacing complex DOM manipulation

4. **✅ Preserved Key Features:**
   - Live preview table regeneration
   - Data preservation during structure changes
   - Smooth animations
   - Visual feedback messages

### Testing Instructions:
1. Go to an outcome in edit mode
2. You should see two sections: "Manage Columns" and "Manage Rows"
3. Enter a column name, select type, click Add - column should appear in table immediately
4. Click the × button next to any column to remove it
5. Same for rows - add/remove and see immediate table updates
6. Existing data should be preserved when adding/removing columns

The interface is now much simpler and focused on basic add/remove functionality with immediate live preview.
