# PCDS 2030 Dashboard - System Context and Design Document

## ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT

Sarawak's Ministry of Natural Resources and Urban Development oversees several agencies:

State departments:
- Forestry Department
- Land and Survey Department

State statutory bodies:
- Land Custody and Development Authority (LCDA)
- Natural Resources and Environment Board (NREB)
- Sarawak Forestry Corporation (SFC)
- Sarawak Timber Industry Development Corporation

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Currently, agencies compile quarterly reports using Excel, generating tables and graphs which are then copied/converted into PowerPoint slides. This process is time-consuming and inefficient.

The goal is to develop a progressive web app (PWA) that replaces Excel-based reporting with a streamlined web-based solution. The system should:
- Allow agencies to submit their sector-specific data
- Allow agencies to track programs with targets and achievements
- Enable the Ministry (admin) to generate consolidated PowerPoint/PDF reports

## SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

- Frontend: HTML (in PHP), CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- Backend: PHP
- Database: MySQL
- Server Environment: XAMPP (Apache)
- Libraries: Chart.js (data visualization)
- Hosting (in the future): cPanel

## Key Components
1. Authentication System - Handles user login and session management
2. Agency Module - Program creation, updating, and tracking for agency users
3. Admin Module - User management, sector administration, and reporting periods
4. Reporting System - Periodical submissions and historical data visualization
5. Dashboard - Summary statistics and progress visualization

## Data Model
### Core Entities:
- Users - User accounts with roles (admin, agency)
- Programs - Core entity representing agency initiatives
- Sectors - Organizational categories (e.g., Health, Education)
- Program Submissions - Progress reports for programs in specific periods
- Reporting Periods - Quarterly reporting timeframes

### Schema Evolution:
The database schema has evolved to use JSON storage for flexible content:
- `program_submissions.content_json` stores variable program data
- Core status fields remain as columns for efficient querying
- This allows adding new fields without schema changes

## User Roles
- Agency Users: Create/update their own programs, view programs from other sectors
- Admin Users: Manage users, sectors, reporting periods, generate reports

## Development Environment
- Local development with XAMPP
- Debug tools available in `/debug` directory for troubleshooting
- Version tracking via APP_VERSION constant

## File Structure
- `/assets` - CSS, JavaScript, and other static resources
- `/config` - Application configuration
- `/database` - SQL scripts for schema setup
- `/debug` - Development debugging tools
- `/includes` - Shared PHP functions and utilities
- `/views` - User interface templates organized by role
  - `/views/admin` - Admin interfaces
  - `/views/agency` - Agency user interfaces
  - `/views/layouts` - Shared layout templates

## Reporting Workflow
1. Admin creates reporting periods (quarters)
2. Agencies submit program data during open reporting periods
3. Programs track status (on-track, delayed, completed, not-started)
4. Historical data is preserved for trend analysis
5. Dashboards visualize progress across programs and sectors

## JSON Content Structure
The application uses a flexible JSON storage approach for program data:
```json
{
  "target": "Example target value",
  "achievement": "Current achievement value",
  "remarks": "Additional notes",
  "status_text": "Detailed status description",
  "custom_metrics": {
    "metric1": "value1",
    "metric2": "value2"
  }
}
```

This allows adding new program attributes without database schema changes.

## Development Notes
- Status values must be one of: 'on-track', 'delayed', 'completed', 'not-started'
- Target dates have been removed in favor of start/end dates for timeline tracking
- The system supports both assigned programs (by admins) and agency-created programs
- Debug tools are available at `/debug/check_program_creation.php` and `/debug/check_status_values.php`
