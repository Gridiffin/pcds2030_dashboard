# Enhance Admin View Program Details Initiative Information Section

## Problem
The admin side's view program details page (`view_program.php`) shows incomplete initiative information compared to the agency side's view program details page. The agency side displays comprehensive initiative details while the admin side shows limited information.

## Current State Analysis

### Agency Side Initiative Information
- Need to examine: `app/views/agency/programs/program_details.php`
- Expected to show complete initiative details including description, objectives, etc.

### Admin Side Initiative Information  
- Current file: `app/views/admin/programs/view_program.php`
- Shows limited initiative information
- Needs enhancement to match agency side completeness

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Examine Current Implementation
- [ ] Review agency side initiative information section structure
- [ ] Review admin side initiative information section structure
- [ ] Identify what information is missing in admin side

### Step 2: Plan Enhancement
- [ ] Determine what additional initiative fields need to be displayed
- [ ] Plan the layout and styling approach
- [ ] Ensure consistency with existing admin design patterns

### Step 3: Implement Enhancement
- [ ] Update admin view program details page
- [ ] Add missing initiative information fields
- [ ] Apply appropriate styling and layout

### Step 4: Testing & Refinement
- [ ] Test the enhanced initiative information display
- [ ] Verify information accuracy and completeness
- [ ] Ensure responsive design and visual consistency

## Files to Examine/Modify
1. `app/views/agency/programs/program_details.php` - Reference for complete initiative info
2. `app/views/admin/programs/view_program.php` - File to enhance
3. Potentially related CSS files for styling

## Expected Result
The admin side view program details will show complete initiative information matching the comprehensiveness of the agency side, providing administrators with full context about program initiatives.
