# Function Redeclaration Fix - validate_form_input()

## Issue Description
There is a fatal error occurring because the function `validate_form_input()` is declared twice:
1. First in `app/lib/utilities.php:60` 
2. Then again in `app/lib/agencies/programs.php:305`

Error message:
```
Fatal error: Cannot redeclare validate_form_input() (previously declared in D:\laragon\www\pcds2030_dashboard\app\lib\utilities.php:60) in D:\laragon\www\pcds2030_dashboard\app\lib\agencies\programs.php on line 305
```

## Root Cause
During the recreation of the `agencies/programs.php` file, the `validate_form_input()` function was copied from the deprecated file. However, this function already exists in the `utilities.php` file which is included at the beginning of `programs.php`.

## Implementation Plan
1. Examine both function implementations to understand their differences
2. Modify `agencies/programs.php` to:
   - Either rename the function to avoid conflicts
   - Or remove the duplicate function and use the existing one from utilities.php
3. Update any references to the function within `agencies/programs.php` if necessary

## Tasks
- [x] Compare the implementations of both functions
- [x] Determine the best approach (rename or remove)
- [x] Update the code in agencies/programs.php
- [x] Test to verify the error is resolved

## Solution Implemented
After comparing both implementations, I decided to rename the function in `agencies/programs.php` from `validate_form_input()` to `validate_agency_program_input()` to avoid conflicts while preserving the specific validation logic needed for agency programs. This approach maintains the functionality while avoiding the redeclaration error.

Key changes:
1. Renamed the function to make it more specific to its use case
2. Updated all references to the function within the file
3. Tested to confirm the error is resolved
