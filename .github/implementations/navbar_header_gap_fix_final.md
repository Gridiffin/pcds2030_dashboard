# PCDS2030 Dashboard - Layout Gap Fix Implementation

## Issue Summary
Large gaps existed between the agency navbar and page headers across agency pages, causing inconsistent spacing and poor user experience.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Dashboard page**: Had specific `dashboard-content` class with correct spacing (`padding-top: 0`)
2. **Other agency pages**: Used default `.content-wrapper` styling with `padding-top: 70px`
3. **Double spacing effect**: Navbar spacing + content wrapper spacing created large gaps
4. **Header components**: Rendered inside content area, adding additional spacing

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive CSS Fixes (`assets/css/custom/agency.css`)
- Applied consistent styling to **ALL** agency pages, not just dashboard
- Set `.content-wrapper { padding-top: 0 !important }` for all agency pages
- Added universal spacing rules for main content areas
- Ensured consistent footer positioning

### 2. Base Layout Adjustments (`assets/css/layout/dashboard.css`)
- Updated comment to indicate agency pages override the base padding
- Maintained admin page compatibility

### 3. Global Spacing Rules (`assets/css/main.css`)
- Added comprehensive content wrapper spacing override
- Applied consistent navbar-to-content spacing

### 4. Component-Specific Fixes (`assets/css/custom/agency.css`)
- Fixed simple-header component spacing
- Ensured dashboard header components have proper margins
- Added universal container spacing rules
