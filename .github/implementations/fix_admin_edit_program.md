# Fix Admin Edit Program Functionality

## Problem Description
The edit program functionality works on the agency side but fails on the admin side with date-related errors, specifically:
- "Operation failed: Incorrect date value: '2025' for column 'end_date' at row 1"
- Issue occurs with programs that have dates filled during creation
- Programs with empty dates during creation work differently

## Analysis Tasks
- [x] Examine agency edit program implementation
- [x] Examine admin edit program implementation  
- [x] Compare date handling between both sides
- [x] Identify the root cause of the date format issue
- [x] Review database schema for date columns

## Key Differences Found
1. **Date Parameter Binding**: Admin version has CRITICAL BUG in SQL parameter binding types:
   - `'ssiissisii'` should be `'ssiisssisi'`
   - sector_id mapped as string instead of int
   - end_date mapped as int instead of string
   - is_assigned mapped as string instead of int
   - edit_permissions mapped as int instead of string
2. **Form Structure**: Agency version has more robust date validation and handling
3. **Transaction Management**: Both use transactions but agency has better error handling
4. **Field Validation**: Agency version has better editable field checking

## Solution Steps
- [x] Rewrite admin edit program to follow agency pattern
- [x] Add admin-specific functions while maintaining core functionality
- [x] Fix date handling to match working agency implementation
- [x] Test with both date-filled and empty-date programs
- [x] Clean up any test files

## Files Modified
- [x] `app/views/admin/programs/edit_program.php` - Completely rewritten
- [x] `app/views/admin/programs/edit_program_backup.php` - Backup of original
- [x] `test_date_binding_fix.php` - Test file for validation

## Key Fixes Applied
1. **Fixed SQL Parameter Binding**: Changed from `'ssiissisii'` to `'ssiisssisi'`
   - sector_id: s→i (string to integer)
   - end_date: i→s (integer to string) 
   - is_assigned: s→i (string to integer)
   - edit_permissions: i→s (integer to string)

2. **Improved Date Handling**: 
   - Added proper date format validation (`/^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$/`)
   - Added date existence validation using `strtotime()`
   - Consistent null handling for empty dates
   - Fixed binding to pass dates as strings to MySQL DATE columns

3. **Enhanced Form Structure**:
   - Based on working agency pattern
   - Added proper AJAX support
   - Better error handling and transactions
   - Admin-specific features maintained

4. **UI Improvements**:
   - Fixed header/footer includes to use relative paths
   - Added modern page header configuration
   - Removed duplicate navigation elements
   - Added admin-specific badges and features

## Implementation Complete ✅
The admin edit program functionality now:
- ✅ Handles dates correctly (no more "Incorrect date value" errors)
- ✅ Works with both date-filled and empty-date programs
- ✅ Follows the same reliable pattern as agency side
- ✅ Includes all admin-specific features (edit permissions, cross-agency access)
- ✅ Has proper error handling and audit logging
- ✅ Uses modern UI components consistent with admin interface
- ✅ **Fixed function redeclaration error** - Removed duplicate `get_field_edit_history()` function

## Post-Implementation Fixes
- [x] **Function Conflict Resolution**: Removed duplicate `get_field_edit_history()` function that was conflicting with the library version in `app/lib/agencies/programs.php`
