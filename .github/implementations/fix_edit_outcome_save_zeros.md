# Fix Edit Outcome Save Zero Values Issue

## Problem

After fixing the display issue, when saving edited outcome data, all values are being saved as zeros instead of the actual input values.

## Analysis Steps

- [x] Previous fix: Display issue resolved - data shows correctly
- [ ] Check JavaScript save logic
- [ ] Verify input field data attribute mapping
- [ ] Check form data collection
- [ ] Test actual save functionality

## Identified Issues

- [x] Issue 1: JavaScript data collection logic - Selector mismatch between column IDs and input data attributes
- [x] Issue 2: Input field data attributes mismatch - Column IDs not consistent
- [x] Issue 3: Column ID/label mapping in save process - Fixed with robust DOM collection

### Root Cause

The JavaScript was trying to find input fields using column IDs that didn't match the actual data attributes on the input elements. The column configuration had numeric IDs while the inputs needed consistent identification.

## Solution Steps

- [x] Fix JavaScript data collection to use DOM-based approach instead of selector matching
- [x] Update input field data attributes to include both ID and label
- [x] Add debugging console logs to track data collection
- [ ] Test the complete save workflow

## Testing

- [ ] Test save functionality with real data
- [ ] Verify data persists correctly in database
- [ ] Ensure no data loss during save process
