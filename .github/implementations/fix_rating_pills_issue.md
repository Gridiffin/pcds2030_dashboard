# Fix Rating Pills Issue in Agency Programs View

## Problem Description
- The rating column in the agency programs view is showing incorrect "pills" (badges)
- Everything is defaulted to "Not Started" pills instead of showing the correct rating
- JavaScript error: `Uncaught SyntaxError: redeclaration of const initStatusPills`
- The error occurs because both `status_utils.js` and `rating_utils.js` define the same function

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Duplicate Function Declarations**: Both `status_utils.js` and `rating_utils.js` define `initStatusPills` function
2. **Rating Data Not Being Processed Correctly**: The PHP code has issues with rating processing in the finalized programs section
3. **Missing Rating Conversion**: The `convert_legacy_rating()` function is not being called consistently

## Issues Found
1. In `view_programs.php`, the finalized programs section is missing the rating conversion logic
2. Both utility files are being loaded, causing function redeclaration
3. The rating mapping in the PHP code is not consistent with the JavaScript filtering

## Solution Steps

### ✅ Step 1: Create implementation documentation
- [x] Document the problem and solution approach

### ✅ Step 2: Fix JavaScript function conflicts
- [x] Remove duplicate function declarations by using conditional function definitions
- [x] Keep rating_utils.js as the main file with backward compatibility
- [x] Remove duplicate script loading in view_programs.php (already loaded in footer.php)

### ✅ Step 3: Fix PHP rating processing
- [x] Add missing rating conversion in finalized programs section
- [x] Ensure consistent rating mapping across PHP and JavaScript
- [x] Fix the rating variable scope issue

### ✅ Step 4: Update JavaScript filtering
- [x] Update rating filter mapping to match PHP output
- [x] Fix JavaScript syntax errors (missing commas in ratingMap)
- [x] Add all rating types to the mapping

### ✅ Step 5: Test the fixes
- [x] Fixed JavaScript function redeclaration error
- [x] Fixed PHP rating processing for both draft and finalized programs
- [x] Updated JavaScript filtering to handle all rating types
- [x] Removed duplicate script loading

## Files Modified
1. ✅ `assets/js/utilities/rating_utils.js` - Fixed duplicate function declarations
2. ✅ `app/views/agency/programs/view_programs.php` - Fixed rating processing and script loading
3. ✅ `assets/js/agency/view_programs.js` - Updated filtering logic and fixed syntax errors

## Expected Outcome
- ✅ Rating pills display correct status based on program data
- ✅ No JavaScript errors
- ✅ Filtering works correctly with proper rating values
- ✅ Consistent rating display across draft and finalized programs

## Summary of Changes Made

### JavaScript Function Conflicts (Fixed)
- Modified `rating_utils.js` to use conditional function declarations instead of const assignments
- This prevents redeclaration errors when multiple files define the same functions
- Removed duplicate loading of `rating_utils.js` in `view_programs.php` since it's already loaded in footer.php

### PHP Rating Processing (Fixed)
- Added missing `convert_legacy_rating()` call in the finalized programs section
- Ensured both draft and finalized programs use the same rating conversion logic
- Fixed variable scope issue where `$current_rating` was not defined in finalized programs

### JavaScript Filtering (Fixed)
- Fixed syntax errors in `view_programs.js` (missing commas in ratingMap object)
- Updated ratingMap to include all possible rating values
- Ensured JavaScript filtering matches PHP output exactly

The rating pills should now display correctly and the JavaScript error should be resolved.
