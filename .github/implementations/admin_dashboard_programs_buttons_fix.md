# Admin Dashboard Programs Overview Button Fix

## Problem
The admin dashboard has two buttons in the "Programs Overview" section:
1. "View All Assigned Programs" 
2. "View Agency Programs"

These buttons currently lead to the programs page but don't properly filter the program list to show only the respective program types. The buttons need to navigate to the programs page with appropriate filters applied.

## Current Button URLs
- View Assigned Programs: `programs.php?program_type=assigned`
- View Agency Programs: `programs.php?program_type=agency`

## Solution
1. **Update admin programs page to handle URL parameters**: Add support for `program_type` parameter to automatically filter programs
2. **Update JavaScript functionality**: Enhance programs_admin.js to read URL parameters and apply initial filters
3. **Test button functionality**: Ensure buttons navigate to correct filtered views

## Implementation Tasks

### Phase 1: Backend URL Parameter Handling
- [x] Update `programs.php` to read `program_type` URL parameter
- [x] Apply initial filtering based on the parameter
- [x] Set appropriate filter states for frontend JavaScript

### Phase 2: Frontend Filter Application  
- [x] Update `programs_admin.js` to read URL parameters on page load
- [x] Apply initial filters based on URL parameters
- [x] Update filter badges and UI state accordingly

### Phase 3: Testing and Validation
- [x] Test "View All Assigned Programs" button navigation
- [x] Test "View Agency Programs" button navigation  
- [x] Verify filters are properly applied and UI reflects the state
- [x] Ensure reset functionality works correctly

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED

### **Changes Made:**

#### 1. **Backend URL Parameter Handling** (`app/views/admin/programs/programs.php`)
- Added `$initial_program_type` variable to capture URL parameter `program_type`
- Added JavaScript variable `initialProgramType` to pass the filter value to frontend

#### 2. **Frontend Filter Application** (`assets/js/admin/programs_admin.js`)
- Added `applyInitialFilters()` function to read URL parameters and apply appropriate filters
- Updated DOMContentLoaded event listener to call the new function
- Added logic to set filter dropdowns for both "assigned" and "agency" program types

#### 3. **Button URL Corrections** (`app/views/admin/dashboard/dashboard.php`)
- ✅ **FIXED**: Updated button URLs to use correct path `programs/programs.php` instead of `programs.php`
- ✅ **FIXED**: "View All Assigned Programs": `programs/programs.php?program_type=assigned`
- ✅ **FIXED**: "View Agency Programs": `programs/programs.php?program_type=agency`
- ✅ **FIXED**: Additional "View All Assigned Programs" link in programs overview section

### **Issue Resolution:**
**Problem**: Buttons were linking to non-existent `programs.php` instead of `programs/programs.php`
**Solution**: Updated all button URLs to include the correct subdirectory path

### **How It Works:**
1. User clicks button on admin dashboard
2. Browser navigates to correct programs page with `program_type` parameter
3. PHP reads the parameter and stores it for JavaScript
4. JavaScript applies the appropriate filter on page load
5. Both program sections (unsubmitted and submitted) are filtered accordingly

## Expected Results
- Clicking "View All Assigned Programs" should navigate to programs page showing only assigned programs
- Clicking "View Agency Programs" should navigate to programs page showing only agency-created programs
- Filter UI should reflect the current filtering state
- Users can modify or reset filters as needed

## Files to Modify
- `app/views/admin/programs/programs.php` - Add URL parameter handling
- `assets/js/admin/programs_admin.js` - Add initial filter application
