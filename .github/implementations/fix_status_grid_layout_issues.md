# Fix Status Grid Layout Issues

## Problem Description
The Bootstrap Grid status grid has layout issues:
1. Timeline headers are covered by the left panel card
2. Program/target names overflow out of the left panel
3. No word wrapping for long names
4. Timeline doesn't start after the left panel ends properly

## Root Causes
1. Using Bootstrap's percentage-based grid (col-2/col-10) doesn't account for actual content width
2. No word wrapping enabled for program/target names
3. Sticky positioning causes timeline headers to be covered
4. Fixed column proportions don't adapt to content

## Solution Approach
Replace Bootstrap Grid percentage system with a fixed-width left panel and flexible timeline area.

## Implementation Tasks

### âœ… Completed Tasks
- [x] Identified layout issues from user feedback and screenshot
- [x] Analyzed root causes of the problems
- [x] Updated JavaScript to use fixed-width left panel layout (280px)
- [x] Replaced Bootstrap Grid percentage system with flexbox layout
- [x] Modified CSS for proper left panel width and timeline positioning
- [x] Enabled word wrapping for program/target names with proper line heights
- [x] Implemented flexible row heights that adapt to content
- [x] Ensured timeline headers start after left panel ends (no overlap)
- [x] Added proper text overflow handling with word-wrap and overflow-wrap
- [x] Updated test data with long names to verify word wrapping functionality

### ï¿½ In Progress Tasks
- [ ] Test the updated layout with various content lengths (in progress)
- [ ] Verify responsive behavior on different screen sizes

### ðŸ“‹ Pending Tasks
- [ ] Clean up any unused CSS classes  
- [ ] Remove test files after implementation is complete
- [ ] Update documentation

## Technical Implementation

### Layout Strategy
1. **Fixed Left Panel**: Use a fixed pixel width (e.g., 280px) for the left panel
2. **Flexible Timeline**: Let the timeline area take remaining space with `flex: 1`
3. **Word Wrapping**: Enable text wrapping with `white-space: normal` and `word-wrap: break-word`
4. **Dynamic Heights**: Allow rows to expand based on content

### Key Changes Needed
1. Replace `col-2`/`col-10` with fixed width + flex layout
2. Add word wrapping CSS for left panel text
3. Adjust timeline header positioning
4. Update row height calculations
