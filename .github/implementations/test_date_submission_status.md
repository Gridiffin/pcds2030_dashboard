# Test Date Submission Issue

## Summary
The user encountered an error when trying to save a changed program:
"Incorrect date value: '2025' for column 'end_date' at row 1"

## Completed Actions
1. ✅ Fixed debug script path issue (`app/config/config.php`)
2. ✅ Created comprehensive date validation in edit program form
3. ✅ Added server-side and client-side validation
4. ✅ Enhanced error logging and debugging tools

## Next Steps for Testing

### 1. Test the Debug Tool
- Visit `http://localhost/pcds2030_dashboard/debug_enhanced.php`
- Submit the test form to verify date handling works correctly
- Check if the debug output shows proper date formatting

### 2. Test Admin Edit Program
- Go to admin programs page
- Try editing a specific program that was causing the issue
- Monitor browser developer tools for JavaScript errors
- Check server error logs for the debug output

### 3. Identify Root Cause
Based on debug results, the issue could be:
- **Browser compatibility**: Some browsers handle empty date fields differently
- **JavaScript interference**: Some script might be modifying form data
- **Form field conflict**: Another field might be overriding the date value
- **Database constraint**: The date column might have specific requirements

### 4. Verify Database Schema
Check if there are any database constraints or triggers that could cause this issue:
```sql
DESCRIBE programs;
SHOW CREATE TABLE programs;
```

## Current Status
The enhanced validation should prevent the "2025" value from being submitted. If the issue persists, the debug tools will help identify the exact source of the problem.
