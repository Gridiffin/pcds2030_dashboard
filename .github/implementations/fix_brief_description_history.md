# Fix Brief Description Change History in Agency Programs

## Problem
- In the agency program update page, changes to the brief description field were only showing the latest change in the history panel, not the full change history.
- Other columns were correctly showing their full change history.
- This happened because the code was updating existing submission records instead of creating new ones for each change.

## Root Cause
- In `update_program.php`, when a submission ID exists, the code was using an SQL UPDATE statement to modify the existing record.
- This approach overwrote previous values, losing the history of changes.
- For proper history tracking, each change should create a new submission record.

## Solution Steps
- [x] Identify the code responsible for updating program submissions.
- [x] Replace the UPDATE statement with an INSERT statement to always create new records.
- [x] Remove the conditional logic that checked for update failures.

## Implementation
- Modified `app/views/agency/programs/update_program.php` to always insert a new submission record when changes are made.
- This ensures every change creates a new history entry, preserving the full change history.

## Benefits
- Complete change history is now preserved for the brief description field.
- Consistent behavior with other fields in the program editing interface.
- Better audit trail for program changes.
