# Fix Missing Row CRUD Buttons in Custom Mode

## Problem Description
When switching to "Custom" structure type, the console shows "Row designer fully enabled for custom structure" but the edit/delete/move buttons are not visible in the row configuration section. Users can see rows like "row 1" and "row 2" but can't interact with them.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue is likely that:
1. The `renderRowsList()` method isn't being called after switching to custom mode
2. The row list HTML isn't being updated with the new button structure
3. The existing rows don't have the proper button elements

## Investigation Steps
- [x] Check if `renderRowsList()` is being called when switching structure types
- [x] Verify the `populatePresetRows()` method updates the row list display
- [x] Ensure the row buttons are properly rendered in custom mode
- [x] Check for any CSS issues hiding the buttons

## Implementation Plan
- [x] Add debugging console logs to track rendering flow
- [x] Fix the order of operations (populate rows before updating visibility)
- [x] Ensure proper DOM element updates
- [x] Test the complete flow from preset to custom

## Changes Made
1. **Added debugging console logs** to track the rendering flow
2. **Fixed order of operations** in the change event handler:
   - Now calls `populatePresetRows()` first (which updates row list)
   - Then calls `updateRowDesignerVisibility()` (which updates form controls)
3. **Enhanced logging** in `populatePresetRows()` and `renderRowsList()` methods

## Expected Result
When switching to custom mode, users should see edit/delete/move buttons for all existing rows and be able to interact with them properly.
