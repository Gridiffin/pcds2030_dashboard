# Add Outcomes Section to Agency Dashboard

## Problem
The agency dashboard needs an outcomes section similar to the admin dashboard to allow agencies to view and manage their sector-specific outcomes data.

## Solution Steps

### ✅ Step 1: Analyze existing agency dashboard structure
- Reviewed current agency dashboard layout and components
- Identified placement after Recent Program Updates section
- Confirmed existing agency outcomes functions and permissions

### ✅ Step 2: Create agency outcomes statistics function
- Added get_agency_outcomes_statistics() function to app/lib/agencies/outcomes.php
- Function filters by agency's sector_id and optional period_id
- Returns total, submitted, draft counts and recent activity

### ✅ Step 3: Update agency dashboard to include outcomes data
- Added require for agencies/outcomes.php library
- Called get_agency_outcomes_statistics($_SESSION['sector_id'], $period_id)
- Passed outcomes statistics data to dashboard view

### ✅ Step 4: Add outcomes section to agency dashboard
- Added outcomes overview section with 3 statistics cards (Total, Submitted, Drafts)
- Included action buttons for agency-specific outcomes pages
- Added recent outcomes activity display for the sector
- Used consistent styling with existing agency dashboard cards

### ✅ Step 5: Test and refine
- Ensured buttons navigate correctly to agency outcomes pages
- Verified statistics display properly for agency's sector only
- Checked responsive layout and consistency with existing design
- Used complementary icons matching dashboard theme

## ✅ Implementation Complete

### Files Modified:
1. **d:\laragon\www\pcds2030_dashboard\app\lib\agencies\outcomes.php**
   - Added get_agency_outcomes_statistics($sector_id, $period_id) function
   - Returns sector-specific outcomes data for dashboard display

2. **d:\laragon\www\pcds2030_dashboard\app\views\agency\dashboard\dashboard.php**
   - Added require for agencies/outcomes.php library
   - Added call to get_agency_outcomes_statistics() with session sector_id
   - Inserted Outcomes Overview section after Recent Program Updates
   - Added 3 statistics cards and 2 action sections

### Expected Result ✅
Agency dashboard now has an "Outcomes Overview" section with:
- **Statistics Cards**: Total outcomes (primary), Submitted outcomes (success), Draft outcomes (warning)
- **Management Actions**: Links to submit_outcomes.php and create_outcome.php
- **Recent Activity**: Shows latest 3 outcomes for the agency's sector with status badges
- **Consistent Design**: Matches existing agency dashboard styling and color scheme

### Navigation Links Provided:
- `submit_outcomes.php` - Main outcomes submission interface for agencies
- `create_outcome.php` - Create new outcomes for the sector
- Sector-specific outcomes filtering throughout the interface

The implementation provides agencies with immediate visibility into their sector's outcomes data and quick access to outcomes management functions directly from their dashboard.
