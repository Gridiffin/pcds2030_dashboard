# Simple Custom Gantt Chart Implementation

## Problem
Create a simple, custom Gantt chart for the initiative view page with specific requirements:
- Left panel: Programs and targets with their numbers
- Right panel: Timeline based on initiative dates with target status colors
- No traditional start/end dates for targets, just status colors per quarter

## Requirements Analysis

### Data Sources:
- **Initiative info**: `initiatives` table (start_date, end_date for timeline header)
- **Programs info**: `programs` table (program_name, program_number, linked via initiative_id)
- **Targets info**: `program_submissions` table -> `content_json` column (refer to submission_id 386)
  - `target_number`: The actual target identifier from content_json
  - `target_text`: Target description/name from content_json  
  - `target_status`: Status value from content_json for timeline coloring

### Chart Structure:
```
LEFT PANEL                    RIGHT PANEL (Timeline - Two Tier Header)
                             |        2023        |        2024        |        2025        |
Program Number | Program Name | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 |
Target Number  | Target Name  | [color] | [color] | [color] | [color] | [color] | [color] |
Target Number  | Target Name  | [color] | [color] | [color] | [color] | [color] | [color] |
Program Number | Program Name | 
Target Number  | Target Name  | [color] | [color] | [color] | [color] | [color] | [color] |
```

*Note: Target Number is the actual `target_number` value from content_json in program_submissions, not a sequential counter.*

### Timeline Logic:
- **Two-tier header structure**: 
  - Top tier: Years (2023, 2024, 2025, etc.) - each year spans 4 quarters
  - Bottom tier: Quarters (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) under each year
- Header generated from initiative start_date to end_date
- Each target shows status color for each quarter based on target_status
- Colors represent different target_status values from content_json

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Database & API
- [x] Create API endpoint to fetch initiative, programs, and targets data
- [x] Analyze content_json structure from submission_id 386
- [x] Build data transformation for Gantt display

### Phase 2: Frontend Structure
- [x] Create HTML structure (left panel + right panel)
- [x] Build CSS for grid layout and responsive design
- [x] Implement two-tier timeline header (years spanning quarters)
- [x] Create flexible grid system for dynamic year/quarter columns

### Phase 3: Data Integration
- [x] Fetch and display programs with numbers (from program_number column)
- [x] Extract and display targets with actual target_number from content_json
- [x] Map target status to timeline quarters with colors
- [x] Handle cases where target_number might be empty or missing

### Phase 4: Styling & Polish
- [x] Define status color scheme
- [x] Add hover effects and tooltips
- [x] Ensure responsive design
- [x] Add loading states

## Technical Approach
- Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no external libraries)
- CSS Grid for layout alignment
- Fetch API for data loading
- Modular, maintainable code structure
