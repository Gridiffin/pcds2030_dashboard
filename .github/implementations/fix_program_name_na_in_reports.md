# Fix: Program Name Displaying as "N/A" in Report Slides

## Problem
- The program name is correctly retrieved from the database ("Furniture Park" as confirmed in PHP logs)
- However, it displays as "N/A" in the generated report slides
- The issue occurs in JavaScript data processing between API response and slide rendering

## Root Cause Analysis
Based on the logs:
1. ✅ Database query returns correct program name: "Furniture Park"
2. ✅ PHP API response includes correct program name
3. ✅ JavaScript receives API data successfully
4. ❌ Program name becomes "N/A" during slide generation

## Solution Steps
- [x] Examine the data structure in the API response to understand the correct property names
- [x] Check how program data is being accessed in report-slide-populator.js
- [x] Fix the property mapping in report-slide-styler.js
- [x] Fix the secondary issue with save_report.php (pdf_path field)
- [x] Test the fix to ensure program names display correctly

## Fixes Applied
1. **Primary Fix - Property Name Mismatch**: 
   - Fixed `report-slide-styler.js` line 1228 and 1300 to check for both `program.name` and `program.program_name`
   - The populator was creating objects with `name` property, but the styler was looking for `program_name`
   
2. **Secondary Fix - MySQL Error**:
   - Fixed `save_report.php` to include `pdf_path` field in INSERT query
   - The database field was NOT NULL but wasn't included in the INSERT statement

## Validation
- ✅ Created comprehensive test suite (`test_comprehensive_fix.html`)
- ✅ Verified property access logic handles both name formats
- ✅ Confirmed backward compatibility with existing data structures
- ✅ Validated code changes are applied correctly

## Files to Investigate
- `assets/js/report-modules/report-slide-populator.js` - Data transformation
- `assets/js/report-modules/report-slide-styler.js` - Slide rendering
- `app/api/save_report.php` - Secondary issue with pdf_path field

## Notes
- The program data structure may have changed or there's a property name mismatch
- Need to ensure consistent property naming between API response and JavaScript processing
