# PCDS2030 Dashboard Function and SQL Error Fixes Summary

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Undefined Function Error
Fixed the `Call to undefined function get_agency_sector_metrics()` error in submit_metrics.php by ensuring that the metrics.php file is properly included in the application. The metrics.php file contained the necessary function definitions, but was not being loaded.

### 2. SQL GROUP BY Error
Fixed the SQL error related to the GROUP BY clause that was incompatible with MySQL's only_full_group_by mode. This error was occurring in the get_all_sectors_programs() function in the statistics.php file.

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Function Loading Issue
The issue was that while the `app/lib/agencies/metrics.php` file existed with the correct function definitions, it wasn't being loaded by the application. We added the require_once statement to the `app/lib/agencies/index.php` file, which is the central file for including all agency-related function files.

### 2. SQL Query Fix
The SQL query in `get_all_sectors_programs()` was using GROUP BY with only the program_id field, but was selecting many other columns. In MySQL's only_full_group_by mode, this is not allowed as it can lead to indeterminate results. We fixed this by including all selected columns in the GROUP BY clause.

## Code Changes

### 1. Added to app/lib/agencies/index.php:
```php
require_once 'metrics.php';
```

### 2. Updated in app/lib/agencies/statistics.php:
Changed:
```php
$query .= " GROUP BY p.program_id 
            ORDER BY (p.sector_id = ?) DESC, p.created_at DESC";
```

To:
```php
$query .= " GROUP BY p.program_id, p.program_name, p.description, p.start_date, p.end_date, 
            p.created_at, p.updated_at, p.sector_id, s.sector_name, u.agency_name";

// Add additional GROUP BY fields based on schema
if ($has_content_json) {
    $query .= ", ps.content_json";
} else {
    $query .= ", ps.target, ps.achievement, ps.status_date, ps.status_text";
}

$query .= ", ps.status, ps.is_draft ORDER BY (p.sector_id = ?) DESC, p.created_at DESC";
```

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **File Dependency Management**:
   - Consider using a more robust autoloading system or a clearer file inclusion structure to prevent missing functions
   - Document function dependencies between files more clearly

2. **SQL Query Improvements**:
   - Review other queries for similar GROUP BY issues, especially when dealing with complex JOINs
   - Consider using SQL subqueries or Common Table Expressions (CTEs) instead of complex GROUP BY statements for cleaner, more maintainable code

3. **Code Organization**:
   - Consider refactoring some of the related functionality into more cohesive units
   - Improve documentation for functions to indicate their dependencies
