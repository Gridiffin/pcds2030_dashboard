# Refactor Inline Styles from Update Program Page

## Problem
The `update_program.php` file contains a large inline `<style>` block with CSS rules for the enhanced target functionality. This violates the project's coding standards which require centralized CSS management through base.css imports.

## Solution
1. Extract all inline styles from `update_program.php`
2. Create a new CSS file `assets/css/agency/program-targets.css`
3. Import the new CSS file into `base.css`
4. Remove the inline `<style>` block from `update_program.php`
5. Ensure all styles are preserved and working correctly

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Extract styles from update_program.php ✅
- [x] Identify all CSS rules in the inline `<style>` block
- [x] Copy styles to new CSS file

### Step 2: Create new CSS file ✅
- [x] Create `assets/css/agency/program-targets.css`
- [x] Add extracted styles with proper formatting

### Step 3: Update base.css imports ✅
- [x] Add import statement for program-targets.css in base.css

### Step 4: Remove inline styles ✅
- [x] Remove the inline `<style>` block from update_program.php
- [x] Keep the link to program-history.css in additionalStyles

### Step 5: Test and validate ✅
- [x] Ensure styles are still applied correctly
- [x] Verify no broken styling on the update program page

## Implementation Completed ✅

### Files Modified
- `app/views/agency/programs/update_program.php` - Removed inline styles
- `assets/css/agency/program-targets.css` - **NEW FILE** with extracted styles
- `assets/css/base.css` - Added import for new CSS file

### CSS Rules Extracted
The following CSS rules were extracted from the inline `<style>` block:

1. **Enhanced Target Entry Styles** - `.target-entry`, hover effects, close button positioning
2. **Target Counter Badge** - `#target-counter`, badge styling
3. **Target Form Elements** - `.target-number-input`, `.target-status-select`, option colors
4. **Add Target Button** - `.add-target-btn` with dashed border styling
5. **Timeline Fields** - `.target-start-date`, `.target-end-date`
6. **Form Validation** - `.is-invalid`, `.is-valid` states
7. **Attachment Upload** - `.upload-dropzone`, hover states, drag effects
8. **File Management** - `.attachment-item`, `.attachment-actions`
9. **Draft Banner** - `.draft-banner` with gradient background

### Benefits
- **Centralized CSS Management**: All styles now follow project standards
- **Better Maintainability**: Styles separated from PHP logic
- **Improved Performance**: CSS can be cached separately
- **Code Organization**: Related styles grouped in dedicated file
- **Consistency**: Follows existing CSS import pattern in base.css

## Notes
- The program-history.css link remains in additionalStyles as it's already properly externalized
- All target-related styles, upload styles, and form validation styles successfully moved
- CSS selectors and rules unchanged to preserve functionality
- No visual changes to the UI - only organizational improvements
