# Move Outcome Details Cards to Submit Outcomes Page - Plan

## Problem
The user wants to move all remaining content (the outcome detail cards and their edit/delete functionality) from the outcome details page (`create_outcomes_detail.php`) to the submit outcomes page (`submit_outcomes.php`). The cards should be placed in a section at the top of the submit outcomes page and labeled as "Important Outcomes".

## Steps
- [x] Identify all code in `create_outcomes_detail.php` that displays the outcome detail cards and their edit/delete logic.
- [x] Prepare a new section for these cards in `submit_outcomes.php`, labeled as "Important Outcomes".
- [ ] Move the PHP, HTML, and JavaScript for displaying and managing the cards to the new section in `submit_outcomes.php`.
- [ ] Ensure all dependencies (variables, includes, session, etc.) are present in the new location.
- [ ] Remove the now-redundant code from `create_outcomes_detail.php`.
- [ ] Test to confirm the cards display and function correctly at the top of the submit outcomes page.

## Tasks
- [ ] Move the outcome detail cards section and related JS to `submit_outcomes.php`.
- [ ] Label the section as "Important Outcomes".
- [ ] Remove the old code from `create_outcomes_detail.php`.
- [ ] Mark this checklist as complete after verifying the result.
