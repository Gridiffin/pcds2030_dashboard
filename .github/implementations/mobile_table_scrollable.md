# Make Program Details Table Scrollable on Mobile

## Problem
The current card-based mobile layout for the program details table is causing usability and styling issues. The user wants to revert to a standard table layout and make the table horizontally scrollable on mobile screens for better usability and maintainability.

## Solution
- Remove the card-based mobile layout for the program details table.
- Restore the standard table layout for all screen sizes.
- Make the table horizontally scrollable on small screens (mobile) using CSS.
- Ensure accessibility and usability are preserved.

## Steps
- [x] Document the problem and solution.
- [x] Remove mobile card-based layout CSS for `.program-details-table`, `.performance-table`, and `.admin-performance-table`.
- [x] Ensure the table is always rendered as a table in HTML.
- [x] Add CSS to make `.table-responsive` containers scrollable on small screens.
- [x] Test on mobile and desktop to ensure correct behavior.
- [x] Update documentation and mark as complete.

## IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETED âœ…

**Changes Made:**
1. **Completely rewrote `responsive-performance-table.css`** - Removed all card-based mobile layout code and pseudo-elements
2. **Simplified `admin-performance-table.css`** - Removed complex mobile card transformations
3. **Updated HTML structure** - Changed table classes to use standard Bootstrap classes (`.table`, `.table-hover`, `.table-sm`)
4. **Added proper horizontal scrolling** - `.table-responsive` now properly enables side scrolling on mobile

**Key Features:**
- Tables remain as tables on all screen sizes
- Horizontal scrolling works on mobile devices
- Clean, maintainable CSS code
- Consistent with dashboard table styling
- No more pseudo-elements or card transformations

The program details tables now work exactly like the dashboard tables with proper horizontal scrolling on mobile devices.

## Notes
- This approach is simpler, more maintainable, and more user-friendly for data tables on mobile devices.
