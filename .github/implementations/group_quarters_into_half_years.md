# Group Quarters into Half Years in Period Selector

## Problem

Currently, the period selector lists all quarters individually. The requirement is to group Q1 & Q2 as "Half Year 1" and Q3 & Q4 as "Half Year 2" for each year, so the dropdown is organized by half-year instead of quarter.

## Solution Steps

- [x] Analyze the current logic for rendering periods in the dropdown.
- [ ] Refactor the PHP code to group periods by year and half-year (Q1/Q2 = Half Year 1, Q3/Q4 = Half Year 2).
- [ ] Update the dropdown to display options as "YYYY - Half Year 1" and "YYYY - Half Year 2".
- [ ] Ensure the correct period is selected and the dropdown remains functional.
- [ ] Test the implementation for various years and periods.
- [ ] Mark this implementation as complete after verification.

## Notes

- Follow coding standards and project structure.
- Ensure maintainability and clear documentation.
- No changes to database structure are required.
