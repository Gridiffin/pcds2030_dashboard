# Fix Date Submission Error in Admin Edit Program

## Problem
When saving a changed program in the admin edit program page, getting error:
"Incorrect date value: '2025' for column 'end_date' at row 1"

This indicates that the year "2025" is being submitted instead of a proper date format (YYYY-MM-DD).

## Investigation Steps

### ✅ Step 1: Analyze Form Structure
- Confirmed that the HTML date input field is correctly structured
- Field has `type="date"` and proper `name="end_date"` attribute
- Value is properly formatted using PHP: `date('Y-m-d', strtotime($program['end_date']))`

### ✅ Step 2: Check Form Processing
- Form processing correctly captures `$_POST['end_date']`
- No obvious issues in the PHP processing logic
- Uses prepared statements correctly

### ✅ Step 3: Compare with Agency Implementation
- Agency side processes dates identically
- Same field structure and processing logic

## Potential Causes

1. **JavaScript Date Manipulation**: Some JavaScript might be altering the form data before submission
2. **Browser Compatibility**: Different browsers might handle empty date fields differently
3. **Form Validation Issues**: Client-side validation might be modifying the date value
4. **Multiple Form Submissions**: Could be a race condition or duplicate submission issue
5. **Database Field Conflict**: Could be submitting to wrong table or field

## Implementation Steps

### ✅ Step 1: Create Debug Script
- Created `debug_form_submission.php` to log all POST data
- Will help identify exactly what values are being submitted

### ✅ Step 2: Add Client-Side Date Validation
- Added JavaScript validation to ensure date fields contain proper format
- Added `isValidDate()` helper function to validate YYYY-MM-DD format
- Added form submission validation to prevent invalid dates

### ✅ Step 3: Add Server-Side Date Validation
- Added PHP validation to check date format before database insertion
- Added regex validation for YYYY-MM-DD format
- Added `strtotime()` validation to ensure dates are valid
- Convert empty dates to NULL properly

### ✅ Step 4: Add Error Handling and Debug Logging
- Improved error handling around date processing
- Added specific validation messages for date fields
- Added debug logging to track exact values being submitted to database
- Enhanced database error reporting

### ✅ Step 5: Create Enhanced Debug Tools
- Created `debug_enhanced.php` for comprehensive form testing
- **Fixed include path issues**: Corrected config path and admin function dependencies
- Added date format analysis and validation testing
- Enhanced error logging for database operations

## Debug Tool Setup ✅
The debug tool is now properly configured with correct includes:
- `app/config/config.php` - Main configuration
- `ROOT_PATH . 'app/lib/db_connect.php'` - Database connection
- `ROOT_PATH . 'app/lib/session.php'` - Session management
- `ROOT_PATH . 'app/lib/functions.php'` - Core functions
- `ROOT_PATH . 'app/lib/admins/index.php'` - Admin functions (includes `is_admin()`)

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing Steps
1. **Navigate to the debug page**: Visit `http://localhost/pcds2030_dashboard/debug_enhanced.php`
2. **Test normal date submission**: Submit the form with valid dates
3. **Test edge cases**: Try submitting empty dates, invalid formats
4. **Check error logs**: Monitor server logs for debug output
5. **Test admin edit program**: Try editing a program and check if the error persists

### Current Status
- ✅ Debug script path issues resolved
- ✅ Admin function dependencies fixed
- ✅ Ready for testing date submission issue

### Debugging Checklist
- [ ] Check browser developer tools for JavaScript errors
- [ ] Monitor server error logs during form submission
- [ ] Verify date field values in browser before submission
- [ ] Test with different browsers
- [ ] Check if the issue occurs with specific programs only

## Next Actions
1. Use the debug tools to identify the exact source of the "2025" value
2. Test the implemented validation with real program editing
3. If the error persists, check for JavaScript or browser-specific issues
4. Remove debug files after issue is resolved
