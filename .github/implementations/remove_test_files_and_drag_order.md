# Remove Test Files and Drag Handle Feature

## Problem Description
Need to clean up the codebase by:
1. Removing test files created during the program name truncation and alignment implementation
2. Removing ONLY the drag handle functionality (grip icon) from the program selector while keeping the order input functionality

## Goals
- Clean up test files to keep the codebase organized
- Remove drag handle (`<i class="fas fa-grip-vertical drag-handle">`) while maintaining program order input functionality
- Ensure the program selector still works properly with order inputs but without dragging capability
- Maintain proper styling and layout

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Remove Test Files
- [x] Delete test_program_names.html (already done)
- [x] Check for any other test-related files that should be removed

### Step 2: Remove Drag Handle Functionality ONLY
- [x] Remove old and new versions of report-generator files
- [x] Remove drag handle elements (`<i class="fas fa-grip-vertical drag-handle">`) from base report-generator.js
- [x] Remove drag-related CSS styles (.drag-handle, .dragging, etc.)
- [x] Remove JavaScript drag and drop event handlers
- [x] KEEP program order inputs and containers intact
- [x] KEEP order-related JavaScript functionality

### Step 3: Clean Up CSS
- [x] Remove drag-handle CSS classes and styles
- [x] KEEP program-order-input related styles
- [x] Adjust program selector layout to remove drag handle spacing
- [x] Ensure clean styling without drag handles

### Step 4: Update JavaScript
- [x] Remove drag and drop event handlers
- [x] Remove drag-related functions and variables
- [x] KEEP program ordering logic and validation
- [x] Ensure order input functionality still works

### Step 5: Testing & Validation
- [x] Test program selector functionality
- [x] Ensure order inputs work properly
- [x] Verify styling looks clean without drag handles
- [x] Check responsive behavior

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

The drag handle functionality has been successfully removed while maintaining all program ordering capabilities. Here's what was accomplished:

### ✅ Successfully Completed:
1. **Test Files Removal**: Removed test_program_names.html
2. **File Cleanup**: Removed duplicate report-generator-old.js and report-generator-new.js files
3. **Drag Handle Removal**: Removed `<i class="fas fa-grip-vertical drag-handle">` from HTML templates
4. **CSS Cleanup**: Removed all drag-related CSS classes (.drag-handle, .dragging, .drag-over, etc.)
5. **JavaScript Updates**: Removed drag and drop event handlers while preserving order input functionality
6. **Code Validation**: Verified no syntax errors in updated files

### ✅ Functionality Preserved:
- ✅ Program selection via checkboxes
- ✅ Program order input fields
- ✅ Order validation and auto-numbering
- ✅ Select All/Deselect All buttons
- ✅ Sort by order functionality
- ✅ Program search and filtering
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ All existing report generation features

### ✅ Changes Made:
1. **assets/js/report-generator.js**: Removed drag handle HTML and draggable attributes
2. **assets/css/base.css**: Removed all drag-related CSS styles
3. **File structure**: Cleaned up duplicate JavaScript files

The program selector now has a cleaner, simpler interface without drag affordances while maintaining all ordering capabilities through the input fields.

## Implementation Details

### Files to Review and Modify:
1. HTML templates with program selectors - remove drag handle icons only
2. CSS files - remove drag-related styles only, keep order input styles
3. JavaScript files - remove drag functionality, keep order logic
4. Test files for removal

### Expected Outcome:
- Clean codebase without test files
- Program selector without drag handles but with working order inputs
- Maintained program ordering capability via input fields
- Professional, clean styling without drag affordances
