# Fixing Corrupted PPTX Downloads

## Problem Description
Generated PPTX files are stored correctly on the server and can be opened without issues directly from the `reports/pptx/` folder. However, when users download these files through the application's download functionality, the downloaded files are corrupted and require repair. This indicates an issue with the file serving mechanism in `download.php` or related scripts.

## Investigation and Solution Steps

- [x] **1. Examine `download.php`:**
    - [x] Check `Content-Type` header. Should be `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation`.
    - [x] Check `Content-Disposition` header. Should be `attachment; filename="your_report_name.pptx"`.
    - [x] Check `Content-Length` header. Should accurately reflect the file size.
    - [x] Ensure no extra output (whitespace, PHP errors/warnings) is sent before or after the file content. Use `ob_clean()` and `flush()` if necessary. **DONE: Implemented robust output buffering with `ob_start()` at the beginning and `ob_end_clean()` before sending headers.**
    - [x] Verify how the file is read and outputted (e.g., `readfile()`, `fpassthru()`). **DONE: `readfile()` is used, which is appropriate.**
    - [x] Check for any session-related issues or permission checks that might interfere with file streaming. **DONE: Session checks are in place, output buffering handles potential interference.**
    - [x] **Enhanced path sanitization and resolution using `realpath()` and checks against base directory to prevent traversal.**
    - [x] **Added more comprehensive HTTP headers for download (`Content-Transfer-Encoding`, `Expires`, `Cache-Control`, `Pragma`).**

- [x] **2. Review Download Link Generation:**
    - [x] Inspect `app/views/admin/reports/generate_reports.php` (or the relevant view file) to see how download links are constructed. **DONE: Links are generated in the recent reports table section of this file and also in the AJAX loaded table.**
    - [x] Inspect `app/views/admin/ajax/recent_reports_table.php` (or similar AJAX handlers) for dynamic link generation. **DONE: Links are generated correctly using `APP_URL . '/download.php?type=report&file=' . urlencode($report['pptx_path'])`. This seems correct as `download.php` now expects `type=report` and the full path from the DB (`pptx_path` which is like `app/reports/pptx/filename.pptx`).**
    - [x] Ensure correct file paths/identifiers are passed to `download.php`. **DONE: The `pptx_path` from the database, which is relative to the project root (e.g., `app/reports/pptx/report_name.pptx`), is being URL-encoded and passed. This aligns with the updated `download.php` logic that handles such paths when `type=report`.**

- [x] **3. Analyze Client-Side Download Initiation (if any):**
    - [x] Check relevant JavaScript files (e.g., `assets/js/report-modules/report-ui.js` or `report-api.js`) if downloads are triggered via JavaScript, to ensure no client-side manipulation is corrupting the request or expected response. **DONE: Reviewed `report-ui.js` and `report-api.js`. The download links are standard HTML `<a>` tags. The JavaScript in these files primarily handles report generation, saving, deleting, and refreshing the recent reports table. There is no specific client-side code that intercepts or modifies the download behavior of these `<a>` tags. The `elements.downloadLink.href` in `report-ui.js` is updated after a successful generation, but it correctly uses a relative path to `download.php` which is standard.**

- [ ] **4. Test Download Process:**
    - [x] After applying fixes, test downloading various reports. **(COMPLETED - Issue Identified)**
    - [x] Compare the downloaded file size with the server-side file size. **(COMPLETED - Server file: 140+ KB, Downloaded file: 398 bytes)**
    - [x] Attempt to open the downloaded file in PowerPoint. **(COMPLETED - Downloaded file is corrupted)**
    - [ ] **CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND**: Two different PPTX files exist:
        - [ ] **Proper file (140+ KB)**: Generated and stored in `reports/pptx/` folder ✅
        - [ ] **Corrupted file (398 bytes)**: What gets downloaded by users ❌
    - [ ] **Root Cause Investigation**: 
        - [ ] Check if the blob being sent to server is valid
        - [ ] Verify the file saving process in `save_report.php`
        - [ ] Debug the download.php process with actual file paths
    - [ ] **Solution Implementation**: 
        - [ ] Fix the file corruption issue during save/upload process
        - [ ] Ensure download.php serves the correct file from `reports/pptx/`

- [ ] **5. Clean up:**
    - [ ] Remove any debugging code.
    - [ ] Ensure all changes are committed.
