# Debug: Missing Row Buttons HTML Generation

## Problem Analysis
Console logs show the logic is working correctly:
- Structure type changes to custom ✅
- Rows are cleared and added ✅  
- Custom mode is detected ✅
- `renderRowsList()` is called with correct parameters ✅

**But buttons are still not visible**, meaning the issue is in the HTML generation within `renderRowsList()`.

## Investigation Steps
- [x] Confirm logic flow works (proven by console logs)
- [ ] Check actual HTML being generated by `renderRowsList()`
- [ ] Verify button HTML structure is correct
- [ ] Check for any HTML syntax issues
- [ ] Test HTML output in browser inspector

## Next Actions
1. Add console.log to output the actual HTML being generated
2. Inspect the generated HTML structure
3. Check if buttons are present but hidden by CSS
4. Fix any HTML generation issues
