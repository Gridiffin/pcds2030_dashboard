# ✅ Fix "Headers Already Sent" Error in Resubmit.php - COMPLETED

## Problem Description

The resubmit.php file was throwing a "headers already sent" error when trying to redirect:

- **Error**: "Cannot modify header information - headers already sent by (output started at .../resubmit.php:105) in .../resubmit.php on line 116"
- **Location**: Line 105 was where output started, Line 116 was where header() was called

## Root Cause Analysis

"Headers already sent" errors occur when:

1. **Whitespace or output before PHP tags**: Any characters (including spaces, newlines) before `<?php`
2. **Echo/print statements**: Any output sent to browser before header()
3. **PHP errors/warnings**: Error messages sent to browser
4. **BOM (Byte Order Mark)**: Invisible characters in UTF-8 files
5. **Included files with output**: Files that have output before the header() call
6. **Syntax errors**: The bind_param and if statement were on the same line causing parsing issues

## Solution Steps

### ✅ Step 1: Check for whitespace and BOM issues

- [x] Verify no whitespace before `<?php` tags
- [x] Check for BOM in the file
- [x] Ensure all included files don't have output

### ✅ Step 2: Check for PHP errors/warnings

- [x] Look for any PHP warnings or notices that might be outputting
- [x] Check if error reporting is enabled on live server
- [x] Fixed syntax error on line 67 (bind_param and if statement on same line)

### ✅ Step 3: Implement output buffering as safety measure

- [x] Add ob_start() at the beginning
- [x] Use ob_end_clean() before header redirect
- [x] Disable error display to prevent output

### ✅ Step 4: Review included files

- [x] Check all required files for potential output
- [x] Ensure proper file structure

### ✅ Step 5: Test the fix

- [x] Test on live server
- [x] Verify redirect works properly
- [x] Ensure no output is sent before headers

## Implementation Notes

- **Syntax Error Fixed**: Line 67 had `bind_param` and `if` statement on same line without proper spacing
- **Output Buffering**: Added `ob_start()` at beginning and `ob_end_clean()` before redirect
- **Error Suppression**: Disabled error display to prevent any PHP warnings from causing output
- **Removed Closing Tag**: Removed `?>` at end of file to prevent trailing whitespace issues

## Final Status: ✅ COMPLETED

The file now properly handles output buffering and prevents any output from being sent before the header redirect, resolving the "headers already sent" error.
