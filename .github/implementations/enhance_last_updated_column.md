# Enhance Last Updated Column with Time Display

## Problem
The "Last Updated" column in the programs table currently only shows dates (e.g., "Jan 15, 2025") without time information. Users need to see more specific timing information including hours and minutes.

## Solution
Update the date formatting in both the draft and finalized programs tables to include time information in a user-friendly format.

## Implementation Steps

### 1. ✅ Analyze Current Structure
- [x] Located the date formatting logic in `view_programs.php`
- [x] Found two instances: draft programs and finalized programs tables
- [x] Current format: `date('M j, Y', strtotime($program['updated_at']))`

### 2. ✅ Update Date Formatting
- [x] Change date format to include time
- [x] Use consistent formatting across both tables
- [x] Ensure responsive design considerations

### 3. ✅ Test Implementation
- [x] Verify time displays correctly
- [x] Check responsive behavior on mobile devices
- [x] Ensure sorting still works properly

## Implementation Complete

The Last Updated column has been successfully enhanced to show both date and time information. The implementation includes:

1. **Enhanced Date Format**: Changed from `M j, Y` to `M j, Y g:i A` format
2. **Consistent Updates**: Applied to both draft and finalized programs tables
3. **Responsive Design**: Adjusted column widths and mobile layout
4. **Visual Improvements**: Ensured adequate spacing for time information

## Key Changes Made

### Date Format Enhancement
- **Before**: "Jan 15, 2025"
- **After**: "Jan 15, 2025 2:30 PM"

### CSS Layout Adjustments
- Increased Last Updated column width from 20% to 25%
- Added minimum width of 140px for desktop, 120px for mobile
- Adjusted other column widths to maintain balance
- Added responsive mobile layout optimizations

### Files Modified
- `app/views/agency/programs/view_programs.php` - Updated date formatting and CSS styles

## Testing Notes

The enhanced functionality provides:
- More precise timing information for better tracking
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Maintained table sorting functionality
- Consistent formatting across both program tables

## Files to Modify
- `app/views/agency/programs/view_programs.php` - Update date formatting in both tables

## Technical Details

### Current Format
```php
date('M j, Y', strtotime($program['updated_at']))
```

### New Format
```php
date('M j, Y g:i A', strtotime($program['updated_at']))
```

This will display: "Jan 15, 2025 2:30 PM" instead of just "Jan 15, 2025"

## Testing Checklist
- [x] Date and time display correctly in draft programs table
- [x] Date and time display correctly in finalized programs table
- [x] Responsive layout works on mobile devices
- [x] Table sorting functionality still works
