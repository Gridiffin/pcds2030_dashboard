## Testing Tools Created

The following tools have been created to aid in testing the forestry theme:

1. **Browser Compatibility Testing**
   - `scripts/cross_browser_test.sh` - Bash script for Linux/Mac environments
   - `scripts/CrossBrowserTest.ps1` - PowerShell script for Windows environments

2. **Responsive Design Testing**
   - `assets/js/utilities/responsive-test.js` - Console utility for viewport testing
   - `assets/js/utilities/forest-theme-tester.js` - Interactive UI for responsive testing

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - `scripts/OptimizeCss.ps1` - PowerShell script to optimize CSS files for production

## Recommendations
1. Complete Safari testing when possible
2. Address minor spacing issues on mobile devices
3. Consider enhancing contrast for Forest Medium color in text applications
4. Run the CSS optimization script before deployment
5. Implement automated accessibility testing with axe or similar tools
