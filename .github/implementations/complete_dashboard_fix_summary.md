# PCDS2030 Dashboard - Complete Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Program Rating Distribution Chart - Incorrect Ratings
**Problem**: Chart showing all programs as "not started" regardless of actual ratings.
**Root Cause**: Hardcoded 'not-started' rating in `get_agency_submission_status()` function.
**Solution**: 
- Updated query to properly extract ratings from JSON: `COALESCE(JSON_UNQUOTE(JSON_EXTRACT(ps.content_json, '$.rating')), 'not-started')`
- Added GROUP BY clause to handle multiple submissions correctly

### 2. ✅ Assigned Program Toggle Not Connected  
**Problem**: Toggle had no effect on chart or statistics.
**Root Cause**: Duplicate event handlers and inconsistent data sources.
**Solution**:
- Consolidated toggle handling in `dashboard.js`
- Created unified AJAX endpoint `chart_data.php` using DashboardController
- Removed duplicate handlers from `dashboard_chart.js`

### 3. ✅ JSON Parsing Errors in AJAX Calls
**Problem**: `Unexpected token < in JSON at position 0` errors.
**Root Cause**: Incorrect AJAX path causing 404 responses with HTML error pages.
**Solution**:
- Fixed path from `ajax/chart_data.php` to `../ajax/chart_data.php` in dashboard.js
- Verified endpoint accessibility and response format

### 4. ✅ Chart Not Displaying Despite Successful Data Fetch
**Problem**: Chart canvas remained empty even with valid data.
**Root Cause**: Multiple conflicting chart initialization approaches and timing issues.
**Solution**:
- Disabled complex ChartManager class in `dashboard_chart.js`
- Disabled competing initialization in `dashboard_charts.js`  
- Implemented simple, direct chart creation in `dashboard.php`
- Added proper Chart.js load detection with fallback polling
- Maintained AJAX update compatibility

## Modified Files

### Core Logic Files
- `app/lib/agencies/statistics.php` - Fixed rating extraction from JSON
- `app/controllers/DashboardController.php` - Consistent rating categorization
- `app/views/agency/ajax/chart_data.php` - NEW: Unified AJAX endpoint

### JavaScript Files  
- `assets/js/agency/dashboard.js` - Fixed AJAX path, consolidated toggle handling
- `assets/js/agency/dashboard_chart.js` - Disabled complex chart manager
- `assets/js/agency/dashboard_charts.js` - Disabled competing chart initialization

### UI Files
- `app/views/agency/dashboard/dashboard.php` - Simple chart initialization, required JS includes

### Documentation
- `.github/implementations/fix_program_rating_chart.md` - Rating extraction fix
- `.github/implementations/fix_dashboard_json_parsing_error.md` - JSON error fix  
- `.github/implementations/fix_chart_not_displaying.md` - Chart display fix

## Key Technical Improvements

### Database Query Optimization
```sql
-- Before: Hardcoded rating
'not-started' as rating

-- After: Proper JSON extraction  
COALESCE(JSON_UNQUOTE(JSON_EXTRACT(ps.content_json, '$.rating')), 'not-started') as rating
```

### Rating Categorization Logic
```php
// Consistent mapping across all components:
'on-track', 'on-track-yearly' → 'on-track'
'delayed', 'severe-delay' → 'delayed'  
'completed', 'target-achieved' → 'completed'
Everything else → 'not-started'
```

### Chart Initialization Approach
```javascript
// Before: Complex ChartManager class with timing issues
// After: Simple, direct Chart.js instantiation with proper load detection
const chart = new Chart(canvas, { ... });
```

## Validation Results

### ✅ Database Queries
- Tested with DBCode extension using sample data
- Confirmed proper rating extraction and categorization
- Verified GROUP BY handles multiple submissions correctly

### ✅ AJAX Functionality  
- Fixed 404 errors with correct relative paths
- Verified JSON response format and parsing
- Confirmed toggle updates both statistics and chart

### ✅ Chart Rendering
- Chart displays immediately on page load
- Chart updates properly when toggle is used
- No console errors or JavaScript exceptions
- Proper responsive behavior and styling

### ✅ User Experience
- All dashboard components work cohesively
- Toggle provides immediate visual feedback
- Statistics and chart stay synchronized
- Loading states provide clear user feedback

## Current Status: ✅ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED

The agency dashboard now correctly:
1. Displays accurate program rating distribution based on actual data
2. Updates statistics and chart when assigned programs toggle is used  
3. Handles AJAX requests without JSON parsing errors
4. Renders charts consistently without initialization conflicts

All functionality has been tested and verified to work as expected.
