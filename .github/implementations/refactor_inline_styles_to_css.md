# Refactor Inline Styles to CSS

## Overview
Refactored all inline styles from `view_programs.php` into separate CSS files to improve maintainability and follow CSS best practices.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Dedicated CSS File
- Created `assets/css/pages/view-programs.css` for page-specific styles
- Added comprehensive styles for the agency programs view page

### 2. Updated CSS Import Structure
- Added `@import 'pages/view-programs.css';` to `assets/css/main.css`
- Styles are now automatically loaded via the existing CSS architecture

### 3. Added CSS Classes to `assets/css/components/tables.css`
- Added `.program-name-col` class with `max-width: 300px`
- Added `.initiative-col` class with `max-width: 250px`
- Added enhanced `.text-truncate` styles for table cells

### 4. Updated `app/views/agency/programs/view_programs.php`
- Removed all inline `style="max-width: ..."` attributes
- Removed entire `<style>` block containing 400+ lines of CSS
- Added `program-name-col` and `initiative-col` classes to table columns
- Applied changes to both draft and finalized program tables

## Files Modified
- `assets/css/pages/view-programs.css` - **NEW**: Page-specific styles
- `assets/css/components/tables.css` - Added table column classes
- `assets/css/main.css` - Added import for view-programs.css
- `app/views/agency/programs/view_programs.php` - Removed all inline styles

## Styles Moved to CSS File
The following styles were moved from inline `<style>` tags to `view-programs.css`:
- Enhanced card headers for draft and finalized programs
- Enhanced table headers with gradients
- Rating badges with custom gradients and hover effects
- Program name display and truncation
- Program type indicators
- Initiative badges with enhanced styling
- Table row hover effects and transitions
- Action button enhancements
- Loading states and animations
- Filter badge styling
- Empty state styling
- Responsive design rules for mobile devices
- Balanced table layout with column widths
- Tooltip enhancements

## Benefits
1. **Maintainability**: All styles are centralized in CSS files
2. **Consistency**: Styles are reusable across components
3. **Performance**: Reduced HTML file size significantly (400+ lines removed)
4. **Caching**: CSS files can be cached by browsers
5. **Best Practices**: Follows separation of concerns principle
6. **Organization**: Page-specific styles are properly organized

## CSS Architecture
The styles are automatically imported through the existing CSS architecture:
- `main.css` imports `pages/view-programs.css`
- `main.css` imports `components/tables.css`
- `view_programs.php` includes the main CSS file via the header

## Verification
- ✅ All inline styles completely removed from PHP file
- ✅ CSS classes properly applied to table columns
- ✅ No errors found in updated files
- ✅ Visual appearance maintained through CSS classes
- ✅ All styles properly organized in appropriate CSS files
