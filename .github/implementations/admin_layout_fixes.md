## Implementation Complete âœ…

All admin layout fixes have been successfully implemented. The changes include:

1. **Header Layout Updates**: Added admin-specific body classes (`admin-layout`) and content wrapper classes (`admin-content`) to `header.php`
2. **Admin Navigation Integration**: Centralized admin navigation include in `header.php` similar to agency structure
3. **CSS Layout Fixes**: Added flexbox layout structure, proper navbar spacing (70px padding-top), and footer positioning to `admin.css`
4. **File Cleanup**: Removed individual `admin_nav.php` includes from all 18+ admin view files

The admin side now has consistent layout structure matching the agency side improvements, with proper navbar spacing and footer positioning.

## Reference Implementation
Based on the agency side fixes:
- Added `agency-layout` class to body for agency pages
- Added `agency-content` class to content wrapper  
- Applied flexbox styles with proper padding-top: 70px for navbar offset
- Ensured footer stays at bottom with flex layout

## Files to Modify
1. `app/views/layouts/header.php` - Add admin body classes
2. `assets/css/custom/admin.css` - Add layout fixes
3. Test all admin pages for consistency
