## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Database Changes
```sql
-- Initiatives table created
CREATE TABLE initiatives (
    initiative_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    initiative_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    initiative_description TEXT,
    pillar_id INT,
    is_active TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 1,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Program-initiative linking
ALTER TABLE programs ADD COLUMN initiative_id INT NULL;
ALTER TABLE programs ADD FOREIGN KEY (initiative_id) REFERENCES initiatives(initiative_id);

-- Program-outcome linking
CREATE TABLE program_outcome_links (
    link_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    program_id INT NOT NULL,
    outcome_id INT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Enhanced outcomes
ALTER TABLE outcomes_details ADD COLUMN is_cumulative TINYINT(1) DEFAULT 0;
```

### Key Functions Implemented
- `get_initiatives_for_select()` - Retrieve initiatives for dropdowns
- `get_initiative_by_id()` - Get specific initiative details
- `get_admin_programs_list()` - Enhanced program listing with initiative data
- `updateOutcomeDataOnProgramStatusChange()` - Automated outcome updates
- `getOutcomeDataWithCumulative()` - Cumulative data calculations

### JavaScript Enhancements
- Initiative filtering in both agency and admin interfaces
- Bulk selection and assignment functionality
- Dynamic form validation for initiative selection
- Responsive table handling with initiative columns

## 🎯 USER EXPERIENCE IMPROVEMENTS

### For Agencies:
- **Streamlined Program Creation**: Easy initiative selection during program creation
- **Better Organization**: Programs grouped and filtered by initiatives
- **Visual Clarity**: Clear initiative badges and indicators
- **Flexible Assignment**: Optional initiative linking with validation

### For Administrators:
- **Comprehensive Management**: Full initiative CRUD operations
- **Bulk Operations**: Efficient bulk assignment of programs to initiatives
- **Enhanced Filtering**: Multi-dimensional filtering including initiatives
- **Better Analytics**: Initiative-based reporting and grouping

### For Leadership:
