# Program Attachments Upload Debug Implementation

## Issue Description
The attachment upload functionality in the program creation wizard (Step 3) shows progress but files are not actually being uploaded to the server or stored in the database.

## Root Cause Analysis
The upload functionality requires a `program_id` to be set before files can be uploaded. However, in the wizard flow, the program might not be auto-saved yet when users reach Step 3, causing `program_id` to still be '0'.

**ADDITIONAL ISSUE FOUND & FIXED**: The AJAX request URLs were using relative paths, causing 404 errors because the fetch calls were being made relative to the current page directory instead of the web root.

## Solution Implemented

### ✅ **Fixed File Name Display Issue**
- Fixed "undefined" file names in uploaded files list
- Added missing fields to upload response: `mime_type`, `file_type`, `upload_date`
- Ensured JavaScript correctly maps server response fields to display data
- File names now display correctly in the attachment list

### ✅ **Fixed Missing Function Dependencies**
- Added missing includes for `is_admin()` and `is_agency()` functions
- Included `app/lib/agencies/core.php` for agency functions
- Included `app/lib/admins/core.php` for admin functions
- Fixed "Call to undefined function is_admin()" fatal error

### ✅ **Fixed URL Path Issues**
- Changed AJAX fetch URLs from relative paths (`app/ajax/...`) to absolute paths using `APP_URL`
- Updated upload handler: `<?php echo APP_URL; ?>/app/ajax/upload_program_attachment.php`
- Updated delete handler: `<?php echo APP_URL; ?>/app/ajax/delete_program_attachment.php`
- Updated download handler: `<?php echo APP_URL; ?>/app/ajax/download_program_attachment.php`

## Solution Implemented

### ✅ **Fixed Auto-Save Dependency**
- Modified `uploadFiles()` function to automatically trigger auto-save if `program_id` is not set
- Converted `autoSaveFormData()` to return a Promise for proper async handling
- Added validation to ensure Program Name is filled before auto-save
- Added user feedback during the auto-save process

### ✅ **Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added comprehensive logging to both client-side and server-side upload processes
- Added Promise rejection handling for all auto-save calls
- Added validation feedback for required fields

### ✅ **Added Debug Logging**
- Client-side: Console logs for upload process tracking
- Server-side: Error logs for upload parameter validation
- Added response status and data logging

## Testing Instructions

### Test Case 1: Upload with Existing Program
1. Fill in Program Name in Step 1
2. Wait for auto-save to complete (or trigger by typing)
3. Navigate to Step 3 (Attachments)
4. Try uploading a file
5. **Expected**: File uploads successfully

### Test Case 2: Upload without Existing Program
1. Navigate directly to Step 3 without filling fields
2. Try uploading a file
3. **Expected**: System asks to fill Program Name, auto-saves, then uploads

### Test Case 3: Upload with Invalid Program Name
1. Enter very short program name (< 3 characters)
2. Navigate to Step 3
3. Try uploading a file
4. **Expected**: Error message about Program Name requirement

## Debug Information Available
- Check browser console for upload process logs
- Check server error logs for server-side validation
- Upload progress indicator shows real-time status
- Toast notifications provide user feedback

## ✅ **Issue Resolution Status: COMPLETED**

Both critical issues have been identified and resolved:

1. **URL Path Issue**: Fixed incorrect relative paths in AJAX calls
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Added required function includes for permission checking

The attachment upload functionality should now work correctly without errors.
