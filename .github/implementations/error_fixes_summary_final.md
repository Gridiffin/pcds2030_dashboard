# PCDS2030 Dashboard Error Fixes Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes all the errors fixed in the PCDS2030 Dashboard PHP application and the solutions implemented.

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Function Redeclaration Error
- **Error**: `Fatal error: Cannot redeclare process_content_json() in statistics.php`
- **Solution**: Removed duplicate function from statistics.php since it was already defined in programs.php

### 2. Missing Functions Errors
- **Error**: `Call to undefined function get_agency_sector_metrics()`
- **Solution**: Updated agencies/index.php to include the metrics.php file properly

### 3. SQL GROUP BY Error
- **Error**: `Expression #11 of SELECT list is not in GROUP BY clause...incompatible with sql_mode=only_full_group_by`
- **Solution**: Modified the GROUP BY clause in the query to include all selected columns

### 4. ROOT_PATH Constant Errors
- **Error**: `Undefined constant "ROOT_PATH"` in multiple files
- **Solution**: Updated references from ROOT_PATH to PROJECT_ROOT_PATH (which was already defined)

### 5. Get Program Details Error
- **Error**: `Call to undefined function get_program_details()`
- **Solution**: Resolved when agencies/index.php was updated to include all necessary files

### 6. Delete Program 404 Error
- **Error**: Clicking delete button led to a 404 error
- **Solution**: Fixed incorrect URL generation in view_programs.php by providing proper view type

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. Function Redeclaration Fix
- Removed duplicate `process_content_json()` function from statistics.php
- Added a comment to indicate the function is defined in programs.php

### 2. Missing Functions Fix
- Added `require_once 'metrics.php';` to app/lib/agencies/index.php
- Verified that metrics.php contained the necessary function definitions

### 3. SQL Query Fix
- Updated GROUP BY clause in statistics.php to include all selected columns:
```php
$query .= " GROUP BY p.program_id, p.program_name, p.description, p.start_date, p.end_date, 
            p.created_at, p.updated_at, p.sector_id, s.sector_name, u.agency_name";

// Add additional GROUP BY fields based on schema
if ($has_content_json) {
    $query .= ", ps.content_json";
} else {
    $query .= ", ps.target, ps.achievement, ps.status_date, ps.status_text";
}

$query .= ", ps.status, ps.is_draft ORDER BY (p.sector_id = ?) DESC, p.created_at DESC";
```

### 4. ROOT_PATH Constant Fix
- Updated references in 4 files from:
```php
require_once ROOT_PATH . 'app/lib/dashboard_header.php';
```
To:
```php
require_once PROJECT_ROOT_PATH . 'app/lib/dashboard_header.php';
```

### 5. Delete Program 404 Fix
- Fixed URL generation in view_programs.php by updating:
```php
<form action="<?php echo view_url('$ViewType', 'delete_program.php'); ?>" method="post" id="delete-program-form">
```
To:
```php
<form action="<?php echo view_url('agency', 'delete_program.php'); ?>" method="post" id="delete-program-form">
```

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Consistent Path Management**
   - Use a single global constant for paths throughout the application
   - Consider implementing a dedicated class for path management

2. **Function Dependency Management**
   - Implement a proper autoloader for PHP files to avoid manual inclusion issues
   - Document dependencies between files more clearly

3. **SQL Query Improvements**
   - Consider using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) instead of complex subqueries with GROUP BY
   - Implement query builder patterns to build complex SQL more reliably

4. **Code Structure**
   - Gradually transition to a more object-oriented approach for organization
   - Implement namespaces to prevent function and class name collisions

5. **Variable Handling**
   - Avoid hardcoded strings in view URLs
   - Use consistent variable naming and case conventions
