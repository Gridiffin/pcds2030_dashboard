# Fix PHP Syntax Issues in Dashboard Files

## Problem Analysis

In both admin and agency dashboard files, there are incorrect PHP closing tags `?>` appearing at the end of lines where variables are assigned. This causes PHP to exit code mode prematurely, making subsequent code appear as plain text rather than PHP code.

The issue appears in files:
- `D:\laragon\www\pcds2030_dashboard\app\views\admin\dashboard.php`
- `D:\laragon\www\pcds2030_dashboard\app\views\agency\dashboard.php`

## Solution Steps

- [x] Identify all instances of incorrect `?>` closing tags in admin dashboard
  - Found multiple incorrect `?>` closing tags after variable assignments
- [x] Remove the closing tags in admin dashboard file
  - Removed all incorrect `?>` closing tags from variable assignments
- [x] Verify if the same issue exists in agency dashboard file
  - Checked the agency dashboard file and found no syntax issues - it already has correct PHP syntax
- [ ] Test both dashboards to ensure the fix resolves the issue

## Implementation

### Fixed Code in admin/dashboard.php

The issue was found in the admin dashboard file where several lines had incorrect PHP closing tags `?>` after variable assignments. This was causing PHP to exit code mode and interpret subsequent code as plain text.

Fixed sections by removing all unnecessary closing tags:

```php
// Before:
$current_period = get_current_reporting_period(); ?>
$period_id = isset($_GET['period_id']) ? intval($_GET['period_id']) : ($current_period['period_id'] ?? null); ?>
// ...etc

// After:
$current_period = get_current_reporting_period();
$period_id = isset($_GET['period_id']) ? intval($_GET['period_id']) : ($current_period['period_id'] ?? null);
// ...etc
```

### Why This Works

In PHP, the closing tag `?>` should only be used when you want to exit PHP mode and return to HTML/plain text mode. For variable assignments and other PHP code that doesn't output anything directly, you should not use closing tags within the code block.

### Testing Instructions

1. Log in as an admin user and verify the dashboard loads correctly with proper styling
2. Check that all dashboard functionality works as expected
3. Verify there are no syntax errors or code displayed as plain text
