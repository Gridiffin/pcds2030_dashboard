# Debug JSON Parsing Error in Report Upload

## Problem
The report generation process has a JSON parsing error during upload to `save_report.php`:
- PPTX generation works correctly (149783 bytes blob created)
- Error: "JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 1 of the JSON data"
- Server response is not valid JSON

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue is likely one of:
1. PHP output before JSON response (whitespace, errors, warnings)
2. Included files producing unexpected output
3. Session/authentication issues
4. Database connection problems

## Investigation Steps

### 1. âœ… Enhanced Error Handling
- [x] Added output buffering to save_report.php
- [x] Added proper Content-Type headers
- [x] Added debug logging

### 2. âœ… Test Upload Process - READY TO FIX
- [x] Created focused test file (test_focused_upload.html)
- [x] Added comprehensive debugging to save_report.php
- [x] Added output capture to identify unexpected output
- [x] **FOUND ROOT CAUSE**: Session authentication issues
  - Session warnings: "Session cannot be started after headers sent"
  - is_admin() function checks $_SESSION['role'] === 'admin' 
  - Database shows admin user has role='admin' correctly
  - Issue likely: session not maintained between login and API call
- [x] Added error suppression to save_report.php
- [ ] **NEXT**: Run browser test to confirm fix works
- [ ] Verify JSON responses are clean

### 3. âœ… Verify Dependencies
- [x] Checked included files for output issues
- [x] Verified database connectivity works
- [x] Confirmed admin authentication logic is correct
- [x] Added error suppression to prevent PHP warnings in JSON response

### 4. ðŸ”„ End-to-End Testing
- [x] Created comprehensive test suite (test_final_upload.html)
- [ ] **RUNNING**: Complete workflow verification
- [ ] Clean up test files if successful
- [ ] Update final documentation

## Expected Outcome
- Save_report.php returns valid JSON responses
- Report upload process completes successfully  
- End-to-end report generation works without JSON parsing errors
