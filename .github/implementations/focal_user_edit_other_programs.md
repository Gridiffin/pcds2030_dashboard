# Feature: Allow Focal Users to Edit Other Users' Programs

## Problem

Currently, only agency users can edit their own programs. Focal users should be able to edit any program, regardless of agency.

## Solution Steps

- [x] Review access control logic for program editing.
- [x] Update permission checks to allow focal users to edit any program.
- [x] Ensure UI and backend logic reflect this permission.
- [x] Test to confirm focal users can edit all programs, while agency users can only edit their own.
- [ ] Mark implementation as complete and clean up any test files.
