# Program Update File Upload Error Fix

## Issue Description
- **Problem**: File upload fails in program update page with "failed to upload files" error
- **Symptoms**: 
  - Drag and drop UI works (visual feedback)
  - File selection works (via button)
  - Actual upload process fails
  - Error message appears regardless of upload method
- **Status**: Drag-and-drop visual improvements completed, but backend upload process broken

## Investigation Required

### ✅ 1. Analyze Upload Flow
- [x] Check JavaScript upload function in update_program.php
- [x] Verify AJAX endpoint URL and parameters
- [x] Compare with working create_program.php implementation
- [x] Check for missing program_id or other required parameters

### ✅ 2. Backend Upload Handler
- [x] Verify upload_program_attachment.php is accessible
- [x] Check for proper error handling and response format
- [x] Ensure program_id validation works for existing programs
- [x] Test file validation and storage

### ✅ 3. Debug Response Data
- [x] Check browser network tab for actual server response
- [x] Verify response format matches expected JSON structure
- [x] Check for PHP errors in upload handler
- [x] Ensure proper permission checking for program updates

## Files to Investigate
- `app/views/agency/programs/update_program.php` (JavaScript upload function)
- `app/ajax/upload_program_attachment.php` (Backend handler)
- `app/lib/agencies/program_attachments.php` (Core attachment functions)

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Debug JavaScript Upload Function ✅
1. ✅ Found handleFileUpload function in update_program.php
2. ✅ Identified field name mismatch: `attachments[]` vs `attachment_file`
3. ✅ Compared with working create_program.php implementation
4. ✅ Fixed parameter mismatches and missing data

**Issues Found:**
- Update page tried to upload multiple files at once with `attachments[]`
- Create page uploads files individually with `attachment_file`
- Backend handler expects single file upload, not bulk upload

**Solution Applied:**
- Replaced `handleFileUpload()` with individual file upload approach
- Added `uploadSingleFile()` function matching create page implementation
- Fixed form field name to `attachment_file`

### Step 2: Test Backend Upload Handler ✅
1. ✅ Checked upload_program_attachment.php for errors
2. ✅ Verified program_id parameter handling works correctly
3. ✅ Tested file validation and storage functions
4. ✅ Enhanced JSON response format

**Issues Found:**
- Response missing `original_filename` field (frontend expected it)
- Response missing `mime_type` field (needed for file icons)
- Response missing `file_type` field
- Using hardcoded upload_date instead of actual date from core function

**Solution Applied:**
- Enhanced backend response with all required fields
- Added `original_filename`, `mime_type`, `file_type`
- Used proper `upload_date` from core attachment function
- Maintained backward compatibility

### Step 3: Fix Integration Issues ✅
1. ✅ Aligned frontend and backend parameter names
2. ✅ Ensured proper error handling and user feedback
3. ✅ Tested complete upload flow
4. ✅ Verified file list updates after successful upload

**Integration Fixes:**
- Frontend now sends correct field names matching backend expectations
- Backend returns complete data structure frontend needs
- Error handling includes specific file names for better UX
- Progress tracking with intervals and proper cleanup
- File input clearing after successful uploads

## Status
- [x] JavaScript upload function debugged
- [x] Backend upload handler verified
- [x] Upload process tested and working
- [x] Error handling improved
- [x] Complete testing performed

## Files Modified
- `app/views/agency/programs/update_program.php` - Fixed JavaScript upload function
- `app/ajax/upload_program_attachment.php` - Enhanced response data structure

## Testing File
- `test_program_update_upload_fix.html` - Comprehensive test documentation

## Results
✅ **COMPLETED** - Program update file upload functionality has been fixed:

1. **Field Name Alignment**: Frontend now sends `attachment_file` matching backend expectations
2. **Upload Strategy**: Changed from bulk upload to individual file upload (like create page)
3. **Response Enhancement**: Backend returns complete attachment data with all required fields
4. **Error Handling**: Improved error messages with specific file names
5. **User Experience**: Proper progress tracking and success feedback

**Before**: Files failed to upload with "failed to upload files" error
**After**: Files upload successfully with proper progress and feedback
