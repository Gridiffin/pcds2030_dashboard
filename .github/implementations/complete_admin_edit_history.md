# Admin Edit Program - Edit History Section Completion

## Summary
Completed the implementation of the edit history section in the admin edit program page. The edit history section was already implemented but had one missing piece - the user name display functionality.

## What Was Done

### 1. Review of Existing Implementation
- ✅ Edit history section already exists in `app/views/admin/programs/edit_program.php` (lines 672-710)
- ✅ Template properly displays submission history with date, period, status, and changes
- ✅ Function `get_program_edit_history()` exists and is being called correctly
- ✅ All necessary includes and dependencies are in place

### 2. Fixed Missing User Name Display
**Problem**: The edit history template expected `submitted_by_name` field but the SQL query in `get_program_edit_history()` wasn't providing it.

**Solution**: Added LEFT JOIN with users table to get the username.

**Before**:
```sql
SELECT ps.*, rp.year, rp.quarter,
       CONCAT('Q', rp.quarter, ' ', rp.year) as period_name,
       ps.submission_date as effective_date
FROM program_submissions ps 
LEFT JOIN reporting_periods rp ON ps.period_id = rp.period_id
WHERE ps.program_id = ? 
```

**After**:
```sql
SELECT ps.*, rp.year, rp.quarter,
       CONCAT('Q', rp.quarter, ' ', rp.year) as period_name,
       ps.submission_date as effective_date,
       u.username as submitted_by_name
FROM program_submissions ps 
LEFT JOIN reporting_periods rp ON ps.period_id = rp.period_id
LEFT JOIN users u ON ps.submitted_by = u.user_id
WHERE ps.program_id = ? 
```

## Edit History Features

The edit history section now displays:

1. **Date**: When each submission was made (formatted as "Mar 15, 2024 2:30 PM")
2. **Period**: The reporting period (e.g., "Q1 2024")
3. **Submitted By**: Username of the person who made the submission
4. **Status**: Whether it was a Draft or Final submission (with colored badges)
5. **Changes**: Brief summary showing rating and number of targets

## Database Schema Used

The edit history uses these tables:
- `program_submissions` - Main submission records
- `reporting_periods` - For period names (Q1 2024, etc.)
- `users` - For submitted_by_name display

Key relationships:
- `program_submissions.submitted_by` → `users.user_id`
- `program_submissions.period_id` → `reporting_periods.period_id`
- `program_submissions.program_id` → `programs.program_id`

## Files Modified

1. **app/lib/agencies/programs.php** (lines 530-535)
   - Added JOIN with users table to get submitted_by_name
   - Function: `get_program_edit_history()`

## Files Already Correct

1. **app/views/admin/programs/edit_program.php** (lines 672-710)
   - Edit history template already properly implemented
   - Displays all submission records in a table format
   - Shows submission details and change summaries

## Testing Validation

- ✅ PHP syntax check passed for all modified files
- ✅ SQL query includes all necessary JOINs
- ✅ Template expects correct field names from database
- ✅ Error handling in place for database connection issues

## Result

The admin edit program page now has a fully functional edit history section that:
- Shows all program submission records as edit history
- Displays proper user names who made submissions
- Shows submission dates, periods, and status
- Provides a clear audit trail of program changes
- Matches the agency-side implementation pattern

The edit history will display automatically when there are multiple submission records for a program, providing admins with complete visibility into how programs have evolved over time.
