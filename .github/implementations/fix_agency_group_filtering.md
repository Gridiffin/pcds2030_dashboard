# Fix Agency Group Filtering Issue - ✅ COMPLETED

## Problem Description
When adding a user and selecting a sector, the agency group dropdown shows no options except "Select Agency Group (Optional)". However, when no sector is selected, all agency groups are visible. This is because the current implementation doesn't properly filter agency groups by their associated sector.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Database Structure**: The `agency_group` table has a `sector_id` column that links each agency group to a specific sector
2. **PHP Function Issue**: `get_all_agency_groups()` function only selects `agency_group_id` and `group_name`, missing the crucial `sector_id` column
3. **JavaScript Filtering Logic**: The JavaScript code tries to filter by sector_id but the data doesn't include sector_id information
4. **Data Flow**: All agency groups (STIDC, SFC, FDS) belong to sector_id = 1 (Forestry), but the filtering logic can't access this information

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Fix PHP Function (get_all_agency_groups) ✅
- [x] Update the SQL query to include `sector_id` in the SELECT statement
- [x] Ensure the function returns sector_id information

### Step 2: Update JavaScript Filtering Logic ✅
- [x] Fix the comparison logic in the `updateAgencyGroupOptions()` function
- [x] Ensure proper type casting for sector_id comparison
- [x] Debug the filtering logic

### Step 3: Test the Fix ✅
- [x] Test with different sector selections
- [x] Verify agency groups show correctly when sector is selected
- [x] Verify agency groups still show when no sector is selected

### Step 4: Clean up and Validation ✅
- [x] Remove any test/debug code
- [x] Validate the fix works across different scenarios
- [x] Ensure no regressions in other functionality

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

### Files Modified:
1. `app/lib/admins/users.php` - Updated `get_all_agency_groups()` function to include `sector_id` in SELECT query
2. `app/views/admin/users/add_user.php` - Enhanced JavaScript filtering logic with proper integer comparison

### Technical Changes:
- **PHP**: Changed SQL query from `SELECT agency_group_id, group_name` to `SELECT agency_group_id, group_name, sector_id`
- **JavaScript**: Improved filtering logic to use `parseInt()` for proper number comparison
- **Result**: Agency groups now properly filter by sector, showing only relevant groups when a sector is selected

## Implementation Notes
- Agency groups are tied to sectors in the database
- All current agency groups (STIDC, SFC, FDS) belong to the Forestry sector (sector_id = 1)
- The filtering now works properly with the sector_id included in the PHP data
- Backward compatibility maintained - still shows all groups when no sector is selected
