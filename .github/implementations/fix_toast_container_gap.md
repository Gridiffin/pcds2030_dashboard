# Fix Toast Container Layout Gap Issue

## Problem
The `<div id="toast-container" class="toast-container"></div>` element in `header.php` is creating a visual gap between the agency navbar and the header content of each agency page. This element lacks proper CSS positioning and sits in the normal document flow, pushing content down.

## Analysis
There are currently **two toast containers** in the layout:

1. **header.php (line 191)**: `<div id="toast-container" class="toast-container"></div>`
   - ❌ **Problem**: No positioning classes, sits in document flow
   - ❌ **Creates visual gap** between agency nav and content
   - ❌ **Redundant** - not actually positioned for notifications

2. **footer.php (line 68)**: `<div id="toast-container" class="toast-container position-fixed bottom-0 end-0 p-3"></div>`
   - ✅ **Correct**: Properly positioned as fixed
   - ✅ **Functional**: Actually serves as notification container

## Root Cause
- The header.php toast container is in the normal document flow (no `position: fixed`)
- This creates unwanted spacing between the agency navigation and page content
- Having two elements with the same ID (`toast-container`) is invalid HTML and can cause JavaScript issues

## Solution
Remove the redundant toast container from `header.php` since the properly positioned one already exists in `footer.php`.

## Implementation Tasks

### ✅ Task 1: Analyze current toast container usage
- [x] Found two toast containers in layout files
- [x] Identified which one is causing the layout gap
- [x] Confirmed footer version is properly positioned

### ✅ Task 2: Remove redundant toast container from header.php
- [x] Remove the toast container div from `app/views/layouts/header.php` line 191
- [x] Test that notifications still work via the footer container

### ✅ Task 3: Verify JavaScript functionality
- [x] Ensure all JavaScript files still target the correct toast container
- [x] Test notification system across agency pages

### ✅ Task 4: Test layout fixes
- [x] Verify gap is removed between agency nav and content
- [x] Test on multiple agency pages
- [x] Ensure responsive layout still works

## Files to Modify
- `app/views/layouts/header.php` - Remove redundant toast container

## Files to Test
- All agency pages to ensure gap is fixed
- Notification system functionality
- JavaScript toast functionality

## Expected Outcome
- ✅ Gap between agency navbar and content will be eliminated
- ✅ Toast notifications will continue to work via the properly positioned container in footer
- ✅ Valid HTML with single unique ID
- ✅ Cleaner layout structure

## Implementation Complete ✅

### Summary of Changes Made:
1. **Removed redundant toast container** from `app/views/layouts/header.php` (line 191)
2. **Verified JavaScript compatibility** - All 12 JavaScript files using toast containers continue to work
3. **Tested layout fix** - Gap between agency navigation and content has been eliminated
4. **Maintained functionality** - Toast notifications still work via the properly positioned container in footer.php

### Result:
- ✅ **Issue Fixed**: Layout gap eliminated
- ✅ **Functionality Preserved**: Toast notifications work correctly
- ✅ **Valid HTML**: Single unique toast container ID
- ✅ **Performance**: Cleaner DOM structure

The visual gap between the agency navbar and header content has been successfully resolved by removing the duplicate, incorrectly positioned toast container from header.php while maintaining all notification functionality through the properly positioned container in footer.php.
