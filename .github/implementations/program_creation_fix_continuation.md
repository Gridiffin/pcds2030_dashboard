# Program Creation Fix - Continuation

## CURRENT STATUS SUMMARY

### COMPLETED:
- [x] **Created Implementation Plan**: Generated comprehensive fix plan document
- [x] **Code Analysis**: Performed semantic search to understand current program creation system and identified multiple creation files and functions
- [x] **Root Cause Identification**: Found that `create_wizard_program_draft()` was incorrectly creating records in both programs AND program_submissions tables during creation
- [x] **Core Function Fixes**: 
  - Fixed `create_wizard_program_draft()` to only save to programs table (not program_submissions) during creation
  - Fixed `auto_save_program_draft()` to properly handle auto-saves without creating submission records
  - Added new `update_program_draft_only()` function for auto-save operations
  - Cleaned up `update_wizard_program_draft()` to remove extended_data column usage
- [x] **Database Schema Analysis**: Used DBCode to confirm table structures
- [x] **Fixed Database Field Mapping**: Updated functions to store targets/status in `extended_data` JSON field instead of non-existent columns
- [x] **Fixed Auto-save Logic**: Ensured program_id tracking after creation for subsequent auto-saves  
- [x] **Updated Core Functions**: Modified `create_wizard_program_draft()` and `update_program_draft_only()` to use correct database schema
- [x] **Fixed Form Data Collection**: Updated both functions to properly collect and structure targets data from form
- [x] **Added Hidden Program ID Field**: Ensured program_id tracking in form for auto-save operations

### DATABASE STRUCTURE (CONFIRMED):
**programs table columns:**
- `program_id` (int, auto_increment, primary key)
- `program_name` (varchar(255), not null)
- `description` (text, nullable)
- `owner_agency_id` (int, not null)
- `sector_id` (int, not null) 
- `start_date` (date, nullable)
- `end_date` (date, nullable)
- `extended_data` (longtext, nullable) - For storing JSON data including targets
- Other metadata fields

**program_submissions table:** Used for submission history only with `content_json` field

## REMAINING TASKS:

### Phase 3: Fix Data Saving Issues ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Fix create_program.php to save all form fields properly
- [x] Store targets and status in extended_data JSON field
- [x] Ensure proper validation and sanitization
- [x] Fix auto-save to track program_id after creation

### Phase 4: Fix Auto-save Logic ✅ COMPLETED  
- [x] Implement proper distinction between create and edit operations
- [x] Fix auto-save to only create submissions during edits (not creation)
- [x] Ensure consistent behavior across all steps
- [x] Add proper status tracking

### Phase 5: Fix Submission History Logic ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Ensure program_submissions table is used for history only
- [x] Fix programs table to store main program information only
- [x] Implement proper submission workflow

### Phase 6: Fix Notifications ⚠️ PENDING TESTING
- [ ] Test step 2 (targets) notification display works correctly
- [ ] Verify consistent notification system across all steps
- [ ] Ensure auto-save notifications appear for all form changes

### Phase 7: Final Testing ⚠️ READY FOR TESTING
- [ ] Test complete program creation workflow
- [ ] Verify no duplicate records are created
- [ ] Test auto-save functionality across all steps  
- [ ] Verify targets data saves properly in extended_data JSON field
- [ ] Test form validation and error handling
- [ ] Verify program_id tracking works correctly
- [ ] Ensure user feedback for all save operations

## IMMEDIATE FOCUS: create_program.php Base Version Only

### Issues to Fix:
1. **Form Data Collection**: Collect targets from Step 2 properly
2. **Extended Data Storage**: Store targets/status in programs.extended_data as JSON
3. **Auto-save Program ID Tracking**: Store program_id after creation for subsequent auto-saves
4. **Step 2 Notifications**: Show "saved" status for targets section
5. **Prevent Submission Records**: Ensure only programs table is used during creation

## APPROACH:
1. Store basic program info (name, description, dates) in direct columns
2. Store targets and status in `extended_data` JSON field
3. Track program_id in session/hidden field after creation
4. Update auto-save to use the correct update function
5. Fix notifications to work across all steps

## KEY FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Database Schema Alignment
**Issue**: Functions tried to insert into non-existent `target` and `status_description` columns
**Fix**: Updated both `create_wizard_program_draft()` and `update_program_draft_only()` to store targets and status information in the `extended_data` JSON field

### 2. Auto-save Program ID Tracking  
**Issue**: Auto-save didn't track program_id after initial creation
**Fix**: 
- Added hidden `program_id` field to form
- Updated auto-save response to return program_id 
- JavaScript properly stores program_id for subsequent auto-saves

### 3. Proper Data Structure
**Issue**: Targets and status data wasn't being properly structured for database storage
**Fix**: 
- Both functions now create proper JSON structure in extended_data field
- Preserves existing extended_data when updating
- Handles both creation and update scenarios correctly

### 4. Form Data Collection
**Issue**: Form collected data but passed it to functions expecting non-existent database columns
**Fix**: Updated form processing to handle targets array properly and store in extended_data JSON

### 5. Database Operations Using MySQLi
**Issue**: Functions used incorrect database schema
**Fix**: All database operations now use correct MySQLi syntax and proper table schema

## TESTING RECOMMENDED

Now that the core fixes are complete, testing should focus on:
1. Creating new programs and verifying all data saves correctly
2. Testing auto-save functionality across all wizard steps
3. Verifying no duplicate records are created 
4. Checking that targets data appears in extended_data JSON field
5. Testing Step 2 notifications display correctly
