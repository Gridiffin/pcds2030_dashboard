# Program Attachments Agency View Fix

## Status: COMPLETE ✅

Fixed agency-side program view attachment display by correcting file paths and simplifying permission logic.

## Issues Found and Fixed:

### 1. Incorrect Include Paths ✅
- **Issue**: Include paths were causing path duplication (app/app/config/config.php) and inconsistent with admin side
- **Root Cause**: Using `PROJECT_ROOT_PATH . 'app/config/config.php'` when `PROJECT_ROOT_PATH` already points to root
- **Fix**: Updated to use relative path `../../../config/config.php` for config, then `ROOT_PATH` for others (matching admin pattern)

### 2. Missing Programs Library ✅
- **Issue**: `app/lib/agencies/programs.php` was not included, which contains `get_program_details()` 
- **Fix**: Added the missing include

### 3. Redundant Permission Logic ✅
- **Issue**: Complex ownership checking logic that duplicated the permission check already in `get_program_attachments()`
- **Fix**: Simplified to call `get_program_attachments($program_id)` directly since it handles permissions internally

## Changes Made:

### File: `app/views/agency/programs/program_details.php`
```php
// OLD includes (incorrect paths causing duplication)
require_once PROJECT_ROOT_PATH . 'app/config/config.php'; // CAUSED app/app/config/config.php

// NEW includes (fixed paths matching admin side pattern)
require_once '../../../config/config.php';
require_once ROOT_PATH . 'app/lib/db_connect.php';
require_once ROOT_PATH . 'app/lib/session.php';
require_once ROOT_PATH . 'app/lib/functions.php';
require_once ROOT_PATH . 'app/lib/agencies/index.php';
require_once ROOT_PATH . 'app/lib/agencies/programs.php'; // ADDED
require_once ROOT_PATH . 'app/lib/rating_helpers.php';
require_once ROOT_PATH . 'app/lib/agencies/program_attachments.php';
```

```php
// OLD attachment logic (redundant checks)
$program_attachments = [];
if ($is_owner || $allow_view) {
    $program_attachments = get_program_attachments($program_id);
}

// NEW attachment logic (simplified)
$program_attachments = get_program_attachments($program_id);
```

## Current Implementation Features:
- ✅ Agency users can view attachments in their programs
- ✅ Admin users can view attachments in all programs  
- ✅ File icons based on MIME type (`get_file_icon()`)
- ✅ File metadata (size, upload date, uploader)
- ✅ File descriptions
- ✅ Secure download links via `download_program_attachment.php`
- ✅ Permission-based access control via `verify_program_access()`
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Consistent styling between admin and agency views (shared CSS)
- ✅ Empty state messaging with links to upload

## Files Involved:
- ✅ `app/views/agency/programs/program_details.php` (Fixed)
- ✅ `app/views/admin/programs/view_program.php` (Reference)
- ✅ `app/views/admin/programs/edit_program.php` (Reference)
- ✅ `app/lib/agencies/program_attachments.php` (Backend)
- ✅ `app/lib/agencies/programs.php` (Backend)
- ✅ `app/ajax/download_program_attachment.php` (Handler)
- ✅ `assets/css/admin/programs.css` (Styling)

## Result:
Agency users can now view program attachments properly in the program details page, with identical functionality to the admin side.
