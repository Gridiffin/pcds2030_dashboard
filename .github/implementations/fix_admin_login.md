# Fix Admin Access Issue

## Problem
Admin login is failing with "invalid password" error after password reset attempt. User can access agency side but not admin side.

## Root Cause
The password hash I used earlier may have been incorrect or corrupted.

## Solution
- [x] Check current admin user in database
- [x] Reset admin password with correct hash
- [x] Generate proper password hash for 'admin123'
- [x] Update admin user password in database
- [x] Test admin login
- [x] Verify admin dashboard access
- [x] Clean up all test files

## Fixed âœ…

**Admin Login Credentials:**
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `admin123`

The admin password has been properly reset with a correct PHP `password_hash()` generated hash.

## Steps
1. Generate correct password hash for 'admin123'
2. Update admin user password in database
3. Test login functionality
