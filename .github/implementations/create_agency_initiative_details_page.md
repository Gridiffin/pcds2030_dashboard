# Create Agency Initiative Details Page

## Problem
Currently, agency users view initiative details in a modal popup. This approach has limitations:
- Limited screen space for displaying comprehensive information
- Poor user experience on mobile devices
- Difficult to bookmark or share specific initiative details
- Less professional appearance compared to dedicated pages

## Current State
- Agency initiatives are displayed in a list on `view_initiatives.php`
- Clicking an initiative opens a modal with basic details
- Modal content is loaded via AJAX from `get_initiative_details.php`
- Navigation stays on the initiatives list page

## Solution: Create Dedicated Initiative Details Page

### Step 1: Create Initiative Details Page
- [x] Create `app/views/agency/initiatives/view_initiative.php`
- [x] Design a comprehensive layout showing all initiative information
- [x] Include sections for:
  - Initiative basic information (name, description, dates)
  - Related programs (programs from this agency)
  - Initiative outcomes
  - Agency-specific metrics/progress

### Step 2: Update Backend Functions
- [x] Modify existing agency initiative functions if needed
- [x] Ensure proper access control (agencies can only view initiatives they're involved with)
- [x] Add URL parameter handling for initiative ID

### Step 3: Update Navigation and Links
- [x] Update initiatives list page to link to the new details page instead of modal
- [x] Update any other places that might link to initiative details
- [x] Remove modal-related JavaScript and AJAX endpoints

### Step 4: Enhance User Experience
- [x] Add breadcrumb navigation
- [x] Include "Back to Initiatives" button
- [x] Ensure responsive design for mobile devices
- [x] Add proper page title and meta information

### Step 5: Clean Up
- [x] Remove modal-related code from initiatives list
- [x] Delete unused AJAX endpoint for modal content
- [x] Update CSS to remove modal-specific styles
