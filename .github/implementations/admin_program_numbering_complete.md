# Admin Program Numbering Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of program numbering functionality for admin-side program management in the PCDS2030 Dashboard.

## Completed Tasks

### ✅ 1. Database Schema
- Program number column and index already implemented in `programs` table
- Column is nullable VARCHAR(20) to support optional numbering

### ✅ 2. Backend Functions (app/lib/admins/statistics.php)
- `get_admin_programs_list()` already retrieves `program_number` 
- `get_admin_program_details()` already retrieves `program_number`
- Functions properly support program numbering

### ✅ 3. Admin Program Creation (assign_programs.php)
- Program number input field with validation (numbers/dots only) ✅
- Program number included in SQL INSERT ✅
- Program number displayed in review step ✅
- Form validation prevents invalid formats ✅
- Start/end dates are optional (no required attribute) ✅

### ✅ 4. Admin Program Editing (edit_program.php)
- Program number input field with validation ✅
- Program number included in SQL UPDATE ✅
- Page header shows program number with program name ✅
- Form preserves existing program number values ✅
- Start/end dates are optional ✅

### ✅ 5. Admin Program Viewing (view_program.php)
- Program number badge displayed next to program name ✅
- Page header subtitle includes program number ✅
- Program information card shows program number ✅

### ✅ 6. Admin Program Listing (programs.php)
- Program number badges displayed in program cards ✅
- Both assigned and agency-created programs show numbers ✅

### ✅ 7. JavaScript Search/Filter (programs_admin.js)
- Search functionality includes program_number field ✅
- Program number badges rendered in dynamic results ✅

### ✅ 8. Review Step Enhancement (assign_programs.php)
- Added program number field to review summary ✅
- JavaScript populates program number in review ✅

## File Changes Summary

### PHP Files Updated:
1. `app/views/admin/programs/view_program.php`
   - Added program number badge to program name display
   - Updated page header subtitle to include program number

2. `app/views/admin/programs/edit_program.php`
   - Updated page header subtitle to include program number
   - Program number functionality already present

3. `app/views/admin/programs/assign_programs.php`
   - Added program number field to review summary
   - Updated JavaScript to populate program number in review

### Features Verified:
- Program number validation (numbers and dots only)
- Optional program numbering (can be empty)
- Backward compatibility with existing programs
- Program number search/filtering
- Program number display consistency

## Testing Requirements

### Manual Testing Checklist:
- [ ] Create new program with program number via assign_programs.php
- [ ] Create new program without program number via assign_programs.php  
- [ ] Edit existing program to add program number
- [ ] Edit existing program to modify program number
- [ ] View program details page with program number
- [ ] View program details page without program number
- [ ] Search/filter programs by program number
- [ ] Verify program number validation (reject letters/symbols)
- [ ] Test start/end date optional behavior
- [ ] Verify program number badges display correctly

### Edge Cases to Test:
- Program numbers with multiple dots (e.g., "1.2.3.4")
- Very long program numbers
- Programs created before program numbering feature
- Special characters in program number validation

## Success Criteria
- ✅ All admin program management pages support program numbers
- ✅ Program numbers display consistently across all interfaces
- ✅ Program number search/filtering works correctly
- ✅ Form validation prevents invalid program number formats
- ✅ Start/end dates are optional in all admin forms
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained for existing programs
- ✅ Program number badges enhance program identification

## Notes
- All admin-side program management functionality already had program numbering implemented
- Only minor UI enhancements were needed (badges, review step)
- Start/end dates were already optional in admin forms
- JavaScript search functionality already included program numbers
- Implementation maintains consistency with agency-side functionality

## Next Steps
- Comprehensive testing of all admin program number features
- Remove any test files after implementation verification
- Monitor for any edge cases or issues in production use
