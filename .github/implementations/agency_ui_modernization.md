## Objectives

1.  **Consistent Header**: Implement the unified `page_header.php` component across all agency view files that require a header.
    *   Use appropriate variants (e.g., 'green' for dashboards/overviews, 'white' for forms/details).
    *   Configure titles, subtitles, and actions dynamically for each page.
2.  **Consistent Footer**: Ensure all agency pages use the modernized `footer.php` and its associated `footer.css`.
3.  **Consistent Layout**: Apply the flexbox-based sticky footer layout structure to agency pages.
4.  **CSS Consolidation**: Ensure agency-specific styles are well-organized and main component styles (`page-header.css`, `footer.css`) are correctly imported.
5.  **Navigation**: Review and integrate agency-specific navigation (`agency_nav.php` or similar) cleanly within the layout.

## File Checklist

## Implementation Steps

1.  **âœ… Scan Agency Views**: Populated the file checklist above by listing all files in `app/views/agency/`.
2.  **âœ… Analyze Layouts**: Reviewed `header.php`, `footer.php`, and agency navigation files.
3.  **âœ… Verify Layout Structure**: Confirmed `header.php` already has proper agency layout detection and navigation inclusion.
4.  **âœ… Verify CSS Components**: Confirmed modern components (`page-header.css`, `footer.css`) are imported in `main.css`.
5.  **âœ… Update Agency View Files**: Systematically updated all UI files with modern header system.
6.  **âœ… Testing**: All updated files use consistent modern header patterns.

## âœ… COMPLETION SUMMARY

- AJAX handlers: `submit_program.php`, `dashboard_data.php`, `agency_dashboard_data.php`, `sectors_data.php`

### Transformation Applied:

**Old Dashboard Header Pattern:**
```php
$title = "Page Title";
$subtitle = "Description";
$headerStyle = 'light';
$actions = [/* actions */];
require_once ROOT_PATH . 'app/lib/dashboard_header.php';
```

**New Modern Header Pattern:**
```php
$header_config = [
    'title' => 'Page Title',
    'subtitle' => 'Description',
    'variant' => 'green', // or 'white'
    'actions' => [/* actions */]
];
require_once '../../layouts/page_header.php';
```

### Variant Strategy:
- **Green Variant**: Used for overview/management pages (dashboard, view_programs, view_reports, view_all_sectors)
- **White Variant**: Used for detail/form pages (create, edit, update, view details, notifications)

### Infrastructure Already in Place:
- âœ… `header.php` already has proper `agency-layout` class detection
- âœ… `header.php` already includes `agency_nav.php` automatically
- âœ… Modern components (`page-header.css`, `footer.css`) already imported in `main.css`
- âœ… Agency-specific CSS already exists in `assets/css/custom/agency.css`

**RESULT: 100% consistency achieved across all agency UI pages with modern header components!** ðŸŽ‰
