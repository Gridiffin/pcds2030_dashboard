## Fix Admin Navigation Reports Link Issue

- [x] **Check if reports directory exists**: Verify the reports directory structure is correct
- [x] **Test Reports link directly**: Try accessing the generate_reports.php file directly via URL
- [x] **Check file permissions**: Ensure the reports directory and files have proper read permissions
- [x] **Debug navigation logic**: Add some debugging to see why the navigation might be redirecting
- [x] **Check for redirect logic**: Look for any .htaccess rules or PHP redirects that might be interfering
- [x] **Verify APP_URL configuration**: Make sure APP_URL is correctly configured in config.php
- [x] **Fix premature output issue**: Moved JavaScript configuration to after headers to prevent redirect issues
- [x] **Test fix**: Verify the reports link works correctly from all admin pages

## Root Cause Found and Fixed

The issue was caused by premature output of JavaScript code before the page headers were properly set up:

```php
// BEFORE (problematic):
echo "<script>const APP_URL = '" . APP_URL . "';</script>\n";
$additionalScripts = [...];

// AFTER (fixed):
$additionalScripts = [...];
$additionalJS = "<script>const APP_URL = '" . APP_URL . "';</script>";
```

The JavaScript configuration is now properly output after the dashboard header include, preventing any interference with the page loading process.

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed `generate_reports.php`**: Moved JavaScript output to after header include
2. **Removed debug files**: Cleaned up temporary debugging code
3. **Verified navigation structure**: Confirmed admin_nav.php has correct links and logic

The reports navigation should now work correctly from all admin pages.
