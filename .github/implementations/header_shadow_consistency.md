# Header Shadow Consistency Implementation

## Overview
Align the green variant header shadows with the white variant's shadow style for consistency across the application while maintaining the forest theme.

## Issues Analysis
- Green variant had different shadow patterns than white variant
- Green header shadow was too diffused (0 4px 20px) compared to white (0 2px 4px)
- Green button hover shadow was stronger (0.2 opacity) than white (0.15 opacity)
- Inconsistent visual hierarchy between variants

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Update Green Header Shadow
- [x] Changed green header shadow from `0 4px 20px rgba(83, 125, 93, 0.15)` to `0 2px 4px rgba(83, 125, 93, 0.12)`
- [x] Maintains green tinting but uses similar pattern as white variant
- [x] Slightly higher opacity (0.12 vs 0.05) to account for green color visibility

### Task 2: Update Green Button Hover Shadow
- [x] Changed green button hover shadow from `rgba(83, 125, 93, 0.2)` to `rgba(83, 125, 93, 0.15)`
- [x] Now matches white variant's hover shadow intensity
- [x] Maintains green tinting for thematic consistency

## Status: COMPLETED ✅

## Changes Made

### Green Header Shadow Update
```css
/* Before */
--header-green-shadow: 0 4px 20px rgba(83, 125, 93, 0.15);

/* After */
--header-green-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(83, 125, 93, 0.12);
```

### Green Button Hover Shadow Update
```css
/* Before */
box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(83, 125, 93, 0.2);

/* After */
box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(83, 125, 93, 0.15);
```

## Benefits
- ✅ **Consistent Visual Hierarchy**: Both variants now use similar shadow patterns
- ✅ **Maintained Theme Identity**: Green variant keeps forest-themed color tinting
- ✅ **Improved Subtlety**: Green header shadow is now more subtle and professional
- ✅ **Unified User Experience**: Consistent button hover effects across variants

## Files Modified
- `assets/css/components/page-header.css`

## Technical Details
- Green header shadow now uses same distance and blur values as white variant
- Opacity slightly adjusted to maintain visibility with green tinting
- Button hover shadows now have consistent intensity across both variants
- Maintains transform and transition effects for smooth interactions

## Validation
- [x] CSS changes applied successfully
- [x] Shadow consistency achieved between variants
- [x] Theme colors preserved for green variant
- [x] Visual hierarchy maintained across both header types
