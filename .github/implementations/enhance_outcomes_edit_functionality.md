# Enhance Outcomes Edit Functionality

## Issue Analysis
Based on the user request, we need to address the following issues in the outcomes editing interface:

### 1. Edit Feature for Rows and Columns
- Currently users have to delete and re-enter data if they make a typo in column/row names
- Need inline editing functionality for both column headers and row labels
- Should preserve existing data when editing names

### 2. Increase Text Display Box Sizes
- Current input/display areas are too small for proper text visibility
- Need to improve the UI sizing for better readability

### 3. Data Persistence Issues
- Adding/deleting columns/rows causes the table to reset to zero
- This results in data loss when users modify table structure
- Need to preserve existing data during structure changes

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Fix Data Persistence Issues ✅
- [x] Analyze current `renderTable()` function behavior
- [x] Identify where data is being lost during table regeneration
- [x] Implement proper data collection before structure changes
- [x] Ensure data preservation during column/row operations
- [x] Add loading states for visual feedback

### Phase 2: Implement Inline Editing for Columns ✅
- [x] Add edit functionality for column headers
- [x] Implement double-click or click-to-edit behavior
- [x] Add validation to prevent duplicate column names
- [x] Preserve data when column names are changed
- [x] Add keyboard shortcuts (Enter to save, Escape to cancel)

### Phase 3: Implement Inline Editing for Rows ✅
- [x] Add edit functionality for row labels (for flexible outcomes)
- [x] Implement click-to-edit behavior for row headers
- [x] Add validation to prevent duplicate row names
- [x] Preserve data when row names are changed
- [x] Add edit buttons with proper UX

### Phase 4: Improve UI/UX - Increase Text Display Sizes ✅
- [x] Increase size of column header input areas
- [x] Increase size of data input cells
- [x] Improve overall table readability
- [x] Ensure responsive design still works
- [x] Add hover effects and visual feedback

### Phase 5: Enhanced Form Validation ✅
- [x] Add better visual feedback for edit operations
- [x] Implement success/error toast notifications
- [x] Add confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
- [x] Improve overall user experience
- [x] Add loading states for operations

### Phase 6: Testing and Polish ✅
- [x] Test column addition/deletion with data preservation
- [x] Test row editing functionality
- [x] Test on different screen sizes
- [x] Verify data integrity throughout all operations
- [x] Create test page for validation
- [x] Clean up any test/debug code

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

All phases have been successfully implemented. The enhanced outcomes editing functionality now includes:

### Key Improvements Delivered:

1. **Enhanced Data Persistence**: 
   - Fixed the issue where adding/deleting columns would reset table data to zero
   - Data is now properly collected and preserved during all structure changes
   - Implemented proper state management for both monthly and flexible outcomes

2. **Inline Edit Functionality**:
   - Click-to-edit column headers with validation
   - Click-to-edit row labels (flexible outcomes)
   - Keyboard shortcuts (Enter to save, Escape to cancel)
   - Duplicate name validation with user feedback

3. **Improved UI/UX**:
   - Increased text display box sizes for better readability
   - Enhanced styling with hover effects and visual feedback
   - Better responsive design for mobile devices
   - Loading states and smooth transitions

4. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - Toast notifications for success/error feedback
   - Confirmation dialogs for destructive operations
   - Better visual indicators for editable elements
   - Improved accessibility with proper ARIA labels

### Files Modified:
- ✅ `app/views/agency/outcomes/edit_outcomes.php` - Monthly outcomes editing
- ✅ `app/views/agency/outcomes/edit_outcome.php` - Flexible outcomes editing  
- ✅ `assets/js/outcomes/edit-outcome.js` - Enhanced JavaScript functionality
- ✅ `assets/css/components/outcomes.css` - Improved styling
- ✅ `assets/css/main.css` - CSS imports
- ✅ `test_outcomes_edit.html` - Test page for validation

### Issues Resolved:
1. ✅ **Data Reset Issue**: Fixed table data being lost when adding/removing columns
2. ✅ **Edit Functionality**: Added inline editing for both rows and columns
3. ✅ **UI Sizing**: Increased text display areas for better visibility

## Files to Modify

### Primary Files:
1. `app/views/agency/outcomes/edit_outcomes.php` - Monthly outcomes editing
2. `app/views/agency/outcomes/edit_outcome.php` - Flexible outcomes editing
3. `assets/js/outcomes/edit-outcome.js` - JavaScript for flexible outcomes
4. `assets/css/outcomes.css` - Styling improvements

### Supporting Files:
1. `assets/js/outcome-editor.js` - General outcome editing utilities
2. `app/views/agency/outcomes/create_outcome_flexible.php` - Ensure consistency

## Technical Notes

### Data Structure:
- Monthly outcomes use: `{ columns: [], data: { month: { column: value } } }`
- Flexible outcomes use: `{ rows: [], columns: [], data: { row_id: { column_id: value } } }`

### Key Functions to Enhance:
- `renderTable()` - Table regeneration with data preservation
- `collectCurrentData()` - Data collection before structure changes
- `addColumn()` / `removeColumn()` - Column operations
- `addRow()` / `removeRow()` - Row operations (flexible outcomes)

### UI Improvements Needed:
- Larger input fields for better visibility
- Better hover states for editable elements
- Improved spacing and padding
- Better visual indicators for editable areas
