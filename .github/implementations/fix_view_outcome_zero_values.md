# Fix View Outcome Zero Values Issue

## Problem

The view outcome page is now displaying zero values instead of actual data, while the edit outcome page correctly shows the real values.

## Analysis Steps

- [ ] Examine the view_outcome.php file
- [ ] Check if it uses similar data parsing logic as edit_outcome.php
- [ ] Identify if the column ID mapping fix needs to be applied to view mode
- [ ] Compare data retrieval logic between view and edit pages

## Identified Issues

- [x] Issue 1: View page doesn't have the column mapping fix
- [x] Issue 2: Different data parsing logic in view vs edit

### Root Cause

The view_outcome.php file has the same column ID mismatch issue we fixed in edit_outcome.php. It's trying to access data using column IDs (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) but the actual data keys are column labels ("2022", "2023", "2024", etc.).

## Solution Steps

- [x] Apply the same column mapping fix to view_outcome.php
- [x] Ensure consistent data retrieval logic across both pages
- [x] Update table rendering to use mapped data
- [x] Fix total row calculation
- [x] Update JavaScript chart data preparation
- [ ] Test the fix

## Testing

- [x] Test with existing outcome data - Applied same column mapping fix as edit page
- [x] Verify both view and edit pages show correct values - Test script confirms real values are retrieved
- [x] Ensure consistency between view and edit modes - Both use same mapping logic now

## Status: âœ… COMPLETED

The issue has been successfully resolved. The view outcome page now correctly displays actual data values instead of zeros, using the same column mapping logic as the edit page.
