# Fix Automatic Date Functionality for Reporting Periods Modal

## Problem Description
The automatic date functionality in the "Add New Reporting Period" modal is not working. The date fields (Start Date and End Date) should be automatically populated based on the selected Period Type (Quarter) and Year, but currently they remain empty.

## Issues Identified
1. JavaScript is looking for `periodName` field that doesn't exist in the HTML form
2. No automatic date calculation functionality implemented
3. Form data mapping mismatch between HTML and JavaScript
4. Missing event listeners for quarter and year field changes

## Solution Steps

### ✅ Step 1: Analyze Current Code
- [x] Examine the HTML form structure in reporting_periods.php
- [x] Review the JavaScript in periods-management.js
- [x] Identify the mismatch between form fields and JavaScript expectations

### ✅ Step 2: Fix Form Data Mapping
- [x] Update JavaScript to use correct field names (quarter, year instead of period_name)
- [x] Ensure all form fields are properly referenced

### ✅ Step 3: Implement Automatic Date Calculation
- [x] Create function to calculate start and end dates based on quarter/period type and year
- [x] Add event listeners for quarter and year field changes
- [x] Handle all period types: Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, Half Yearly 1, Half Yearly 2

### ✅ Step 4: Update Date Logic
- [x] Q1: January 1 - March 31
- [x] Q2: April 1 - June 30
- [x] Q3: July 1 - September 30
- [x] Q4: October 1 - December 31
- [x] Half Yearly 1: January 1 - June 30
- [x] Half Yearly 2: July 1 - December 31

### ✅ Step 5: Testing
- [x] Test all period types with different years
- [x] Verify dates are correctly calculated and populated
- [x] Test form submission with auto-populated dates
- [x] Test modal reset functionality
- [x] Create test files to verify functionality

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The automatic date functionality for the reporting periods modal has been successfully implemented and tested. 

### Summary of Changes Made:

1. **Fixed Form Data Mapping**: Updated JavaScript to use correct field names (`quarter`, `year`) instead of the non-existent `period_name` field.

2. **Implemented Automatic Date Calculation**: Added `calculatePeriodDates()` and `updateDateFields()` functions to automatically calculate start and end dates based on selected period type and year.

3. **Added Event Listeners**: Implemented change event listeners for quarter and year fields to trigger automatic date updates.

4. **Enhanced Modal Reset**: Improved modal reset functionality to clear date fields when modal is hidden.

### How It Works:

- When user selects a Period Type (Q1-Q4, Half Yearly 1/2) and enters a Year, the Start Date and End Date fields automatically populate
- Date calculations follow standard business quarters and half-yearly periods
- All form data is properly mapped for submission to the backend
- Modal resets correctly when closed

### Date Calculation Logic:
- **Q1**: January 1 - March 31
- **Q2**: April 1 - June 30  
- **Q3**: July 1 - September 30
- **Q4**: October 1 - December 31
- **Half Yearly 1**: January 1 - June 30
- **Half Yearly 2**: July 1 - December 31

The functionality is now working correctly and users can create new reporting periods with automatically calculated dates.

## Implementation Details

### Date Calculation Rules
```javascript
const dateRanges = {
    1: { start: [0, 1], end: [2, 31] },     // Q1: Jan 1 - Mar 31
    2: { start: [3, 1], end: [5, 30] },     // Q2: Apr 1 - Jun 30
    3: { start: [6, 1], end: [8, 30] },     // Q3: Jul 1 - Sep 30
    4: { start: [9, 1], end: [11, 31] },    // Q4: Oct 1 - Dec 31
    5: { start: [0, 1], end: [5, 30] },     // Half Yearly 1: Jan 1 - Jun 30
    6: { start: [6, 1], end: [11, 31] }     // Half Yearly 2: Jul 1 - Dec 31
};
```

### Required Functions
1. `calculatePeriodDates(quarter, year)` - Calculate start and end dates
2. `updateDateFields()` - Update the readonly date fields
3. Event listeners for quarter and year changes
4. Fix form data collection in `savePeriod()` function
