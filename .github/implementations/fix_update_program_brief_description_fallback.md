# Fix: Fallback for Brief Description in Update Program Page

## Problem
- The brief description field on the update program page should always be populated.
- The fallback logic currently tries to get `brief_description` from a non-existent column in the `programs` table.
- The actual data is stored in the `content` JSON column of the `programs` table.

## Solution Steps
- [x] Update backend logic (in `get_program_details()` or equivalent) to extract `brief_description` from the `content` JSON column if not present in the latest submission.
- [x] Ensure the frontend (`update_program.php`) uses this value as a fallback.
- [x] Test the update program page to confirm the brief description is always populated.
- [x] Mark this implementation as complete in this log.

## Notes
- The fallback logic now checks the `content_json` column in the `programs` table and extracts `brief_description` if available.
- All database operations remain parameterized and secure.
- No schema changes were needed; only logic was updated to match the actual data storage.
- Further refactoring is suggested if similar JSON extraction is needed elsewhere.

**Status: Complete**
