- [x] `app/lib/admins/statistics.php` - Enhanced admin program functions
- [x] `app/api/get_period_programs.php` - Updated to include initiative data
- [x] Database migration files for initiative_id column

#### Agency Interface Files
- [x] `app/views/agency/programs/create_program.php` - Added initiative selection
- [x] `app/views/agency/programs/update_program.php` - Added initiative editing
- [x] `app/views/agency/programs/view_programs.php` - Added initiative display and filtering
- [x] `assets/js/agency/view_programs.js` - Enhanced filtering logic

#### Admin Interface Files
- [x] `app/views/admin/programs/programs.php` - Enhanced with initiative columns and filtering
- [x] `app/views/admin/programs/bulk_assign_initiatives.php` - Bulk assignment interface
- [x] `assets/js/admin/programs_admin.js` - Updated filtering and display logic
- [x] `assets/js/admin/bulk_assign_initiatives.js` - Bulk assignment functionality
- [x] `assets/css/components/bulk-assignment.css` - Styling for bulk operations

### Key Features Implemented:

#### 1. Program Creation & Editing
- Initiative selection dropdown in both agency forms
- Validation to ensure valid initiative selection
- Proper form handling and error management
- Seamless integration with existing program workflow

#### 2. Program Listings & Filtering
- Initiative badges displayed prominently in program lists
- Filtering by initiative across both agency and admin views
- "Not Linked to Initiative" option for comprehensive filtering
- Visual indicators for programs without initiative assignments

#### 3. Bulk Assignment Tools
- Administrative interface for bulk initiative assignment
- Support for assigning multiple programs to an initiative
- Ability to remove initiative assignments in bulk
- Comprehensive selection and filtering tools

#### 4. Visual Design & UX
- Consistent initiative badges with lightbulb icons
- Clear visual distinction between linked and unlinked programs
- Responsive design for all new interface elements
- Intuitive filtering and selection mechanisms

### Data Flow:
1. **Program Creation**: Agency selects initiative → Validated → Stored in database
2. **Program Display**: Initiative data retrieved → Displayed with badges → Filterable
3. **Bulk Assignment**: Admin selects programs → Chooses initiative → Updates applied
4. **Reporting**: Programs grouped by initiative → Enhanced analytics → Better insights

### Testing Results:
- [x] All form validations working correctly
- [x] Initiative data properly saved and retrieved
- [x] Filtering functionality operational across all views
- [x] Bulk assignment tested with multiple programs
- [x] No JavaScript or PHP errors detected
- [x] Database integrity maintained throughout all operations

### Performance Considerations:
- [x] Database queries optimized with proper JOINs
- [x] Initiative data cached for repeated use
- [x] Filtering implemented efficiently on both client and server side
- [x] Bulk operations designed to minimize database calls

## Final Implementation Status: COMPLETE ✅

The Program-Initiative Linking system has been successfully implemented with full functionality:

✅ **Database Integration**: Proper foreign key relationships established
✅ **Agency Interface**: Complete program-initiative linking in creation and editing
✅ **Admin Interface**: Enhanced management with filtering and bulk assignment
✅ **Visual Design**: Consistent badges and indicators throughout
✅ **Performance**: Optimized queries and efficient data handling
✅ **User Experience**: Intuitive interfaces with proper validation and feedback

The linking system now provides the foundation for initiative-based reporting and strategic program management within the PCDS2030 Dashboard.

### Security Considerations
- Validate initiative selections server-side
- Ensure agencies can only assign to initiatives they have permission for
- Prevent assignment to inactive initiatives
- Sanitize all initiative-related inputs
