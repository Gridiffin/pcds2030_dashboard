# Fix: Row Buttons Present But Not Clickable

## Problem Analysis
✅ **Confirmed**: Buttons are present in DOM  
❌ **Issue**: Buttons are not clickable/interactive

## Potential Causes
1. **CSS Issues**:
   - `pointer-events: none` on parent elements
   - Z-index stacking issues
   - Overlay elements blocking clicks

2. **JavaScript Issues**:
   - `tableDesigner` variable not in global scope
   - `onclick` handlers not working
   - Event delegation problems

3. **Bootstrap/Framework Issues**:
   - CSS framework conflicts
   - Button styling preventing clicks

## Investigation Steps
- [x] Check CSS `pointer-events` on `.row-actions` and parent elements
- [x] Verify `tableDesigner` is accessible in global scope (Found the issue!)
- [x] Test manual click events in console
- [x] Check for overlapping elements
- [x] Switch from `onclick` to proper event delegation

## Implementation Plan
1. [x] **Check CSS Issues**: Buttons are present and visible
2. [x] **Fix Global Scope**: Issue was `onclick="tableDesigner.editRow()"` couldn't find the global variable
3. [x] **Add Event Delegation**: Replaced `onclick` with proper event listeners using CSS classes
4. [x] **Test Click Functionality**: Added debugging console logs

## Changes Made

### 1. **Replaced onclick attributes with CSS classes**:
- `onclick="tableDesigner.editRow()"` → `class="edit-row-btn"`
- `onclick="tableDesigner.removeRow()"` → `class="remove-row-btn"`  
- `onclick="tableDesigner.moveRowUp()"` → `class="move-row-up-btn"`
- `onclick="tableDesigner.moveRowDown()"` → `class="move-row-down-btn"`

### 2. **Added data-row-index attribute**:
- Each row item now has `data-row-index="${index}"` for identifying which row was clicked

### 3. **Implemented event delegation**:
- Added click event listener that uses `e.target.closest()` to find button clicks
- Uses `dataset.rowIndex` to get the row index
- Calls the appropriate method (`editRow`, `removeRow`, etc.)
