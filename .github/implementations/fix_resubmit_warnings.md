# ✅ Fix Resubmit.php Warnings - COMPLETED

## Problem Description

The resubmit.php file had two warnings:

1. **Warning: Undefined array key "admin_id"** in line 105 - The code was trying to access `$_SESSION['admin_id']` but the session uses `user_id` instead
2. **Warning: Array to string conversion** in audit_log.php line 52 - The code was passing an array to `log_audit_action()` but it expects individual parameters

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Session Key Mismatch**: The code used `$_SESSION['admin_id']` but throughout the codebase, the session key is `$_SESSION['user_id']`
2. **Function Call Mismatch**: The code called `log_audit_action($log_data)` with an array, but the function expects individual parameters
3. **Duplicate Audit Logging**: The code was calling `log_audit_action()` twice with different approaches

## Solution Steps

### ✅ Step 1: Analyze the current code structure

- [x] Identify the warning locations
- [x] Check session variable usage across the codebase
- [x] Review the audit_log function signature

### ✅ Step 2: Fix the session key issue

- [x] Replace `$_SESSION['admin_id']` with `$_SESSION['user_id']`
- [x] Ensure consistency with the rest of the codebase

### ✅ Step 3: Fix the audit logging issue

- [x] Remove the duplicate/incorrect audit log call
- [x] Use the proper audit logging pattern that's already implemented correctly

### ✅ Step 4: Clean up redundant code

- [x] Remove duplicate audit logging
- [x] Remove unnecessary log_action call if it's redundant
- [x] Remove duplicate require statements
- [x] Uncomment the redirect header

### ✅ Step 5: Test the fixes

- [x] Verify no warnings are generated
- [x] Ensure audit logging works correctly
- [x] Test the resubmit functionality

## Implementation Notes

- The code already has proper audit logging using the correct function signature in lines 72, 83, and 91
- The problematic code is in lines 104-111 where it tries to use an old audit logging pattern
- Need to remove the redundant logging and fix the session variable
