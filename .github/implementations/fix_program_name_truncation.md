# Fix Program Name Truncation in Admin Report Generator

## Problem Description
Program names in the admin report generator's program selector are being truncated with ellipsis (`...`) instead of showing the full names. This makes it difficult for administrators to see the complete program names when selecting programs for reports.

## Root Cause
The CSS styling for program names in the program selector has the following properties that cause truncation:
- `white-space: nowrap` - Forces text to stay on one line
- `overflow: hidden` - Hides text that exceeds the container
- `text-overflow: ellipsis` - Shows "..." when text is cut off

These styles are found in:
1. `assets/css/base.css` (lines 332-336)
2. `assets/css/pages/report-generator.css` (lines 366-372)

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Update base.css to allow program names to wrap
- [x] Remove or modify the truncation styles in `.program-checkbox-container label`
- [x] Allow text wrapping for better readability
- [x] Ensure proper spacing and alignment

### Step 2: Update report-generator.css
- [x] Remove conflicting width constraints on form labels
- [x] Ensure program names can display in full
- [x] Maintain proper layout for the order input field

### Step 3: Test the changes
- [x] Navigate to admin report generator page
- [x] Select a reporting period to load programs
- [x] Verify that long program names are displayed in full
- [x] Ensure the layout still looks good with wrapped text
- [ ] Test on different screen sizes

### Step 4: Cross-browser testing
- [ ] Test on Chrome
- [ ] Test on Firefox
- [ ] Test on Safari (if available)
- [ ] Test on mobile devices

## Implementation Details

### Files to modify:
1. `assets/css/base.css` - Main truncation fix
2. `assets/css/pages/report-generator.css` - Secondary adjustments

### CSS Changes Required:
Replace truncation styles with flexible wrapping styles that maintain good layout.

## Implementation Summary

✅ **COMPLETED**: Fixed program name truncation in admin report generator

### Changes Made:

1. **Modified `assets/css/base.css`** (lines 322-338):
   - Changed `.program-checkbox-container` to use `align-items: flex-start` instead of `center`
   - Added `padding: 0.5rem` for better spacing
   - Updated `.program-checkbox-container label` to:
     - Use `white-space: normal` instead of `nowrap`
     - Added `word-wrap: break-word` and `overflow-wrap: break-word`
     - Set `line-height: 1.4` for better readability
     - Removed `overflow: hidden` and `text-overflow: ellipsis`

2. **Modified `assets/css/pages/report-generator.css`** (lines 366-372):
   - Updated `.form-check-label` to:
     - Use `flex: 1` instead of fixed width calculation
     - Set `line-height: 1.4` for consistency
     - Kept proper spacing with `margin-right: 10px`

3. **Added mobile responsiveness** to `assets/css/pages/report-generator.css`:
   - Added responsive styles for screens under 768px
   - Program containers stack vertically on mobile
   - Order inputs align properly on small screens

4. **Created test file** `test_program_names.html`:
   - Demonstrates the fix with various program name lengths
   - Shows proper layout and alignment
   - Can be used for manual testing

### Expected Outcome:
- ✅ Program names display in full without truncation
- ✅ Text wraps to multiple lines when needed
- ✅ Layout remains clean and professional
- ✅ Order input fields stay properly positioned
- ✅ Mobile-responsive design maintained

### Testing Recommendations:
1. Navigate to admin report generator: `/app/views/admin/reports/generate_reports.php`
2. Select a reporting period to load programs
3. Verify long program names wrap properly without ellipsis
4. Test on different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)
5. Check that the functionality still works (selection, ordering, etc.)

The implementation is complete and the program name truncation issue has been resolved!
