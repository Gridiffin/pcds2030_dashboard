# Debug Chart Generation Issue

## Problem - SOLVED! üéØ
Chart initialization is being called and data is loaded correctly, but the chart is not actually rendering on the page. 

**Root Cause Found**: Chart.js library was not being loaded! The JavaScript code was trying to use Chart.js but the library itself was missing from the page.

## Solution Applied ‚úÖ
Added Chart.js CDN to the `$additionalScripts` array in `view_outcome.php`:
```php
$additionalScripts = [
    'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/chart.js@4.4.0/dist/chart.umd.js',  // ‚Üê ADDED THIS
    APP_URL . '/assets/js/outcomes/view-outcome.js',
    APP_URL . '/assets/js/outcomes/chart-manager.js'
];
```

## Additional Debugging Added ‚úÖ
- Enhanced error handling in `updateChart()` function
- Added try-catch blocks for better error detection
- More detailed console logging throughout the chart creation process

## Debugging Tasks

- [ ] Check if `updateChart()` is being called from `initializeChart()`
- [ ] Verify if `prepareChartData()` is returning valid data
- [ ] Check if `initializeOutcomeChart()` is being called
- [ ] Verify Chart.js library is loaded properly
- [ ] Check for any JavaScript errors or issues in chart creation
- [ ] Inspect the chart canvas element
- [ ] Test with simple hardcoded chart data

## Investigation Steps

### Step 1: Check Function Call Chain
- [ ] Add debugging to see if `updateChart()` is called
- [ ] Verify `prepareChartData()` execution
- [ ] Check `initializeOutcomeChart()` execution

### Step 2: Verify Chart.js Library
- [ ] Check if Chart.js is loaded in browser
- [ ] Verify Chart constructor is available
- [ ] Test basic Chart.js functionality

### Step 3: Canvas Element Check
- [ ] Verify canvas element exists and is accessible
- [ ] Check canvas dimensions and visibility
- [ ] Test canvas context availability

### Step 4: Data Validation
- [ ] Verify data format is correct for Chart.js
- [ ] Check if datasets and labels are properly formatted
- [ ] Test with minimal sample data
