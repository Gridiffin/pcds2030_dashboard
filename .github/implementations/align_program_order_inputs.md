# Align Program Order Inputs in Column

## Problem Description
Following the program name truncation fix, the program order inputs need to be better aligned to form a consistent column on the right-hand side of the program selector section. Currently, they may not be perfectly aligned due to varying text lengths and wrapping.

## Goal
Create a clean, consistent column alignment for all program order inputs that:
- Aligns all order inputs to the right side
- Forms a neat vertical column
- Maintains proper spacing from the program names
- Works well with wrapped text
- Remains responsive on mobile devices

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Analyze current CSS structure
- [x] Review current program selector CSS
- [x] Identify alignment issues
- [x] Plan the optimal layout approach

### Step 2: Implement CSS improvements
- [x] Modify `.program-checkbox-container` layout
- [x] Ensure consistent width and alignment for order inputs
- [x] Add proper spacing and margin controls
- [x] Test with various text lengths

### Step 3: Enhance mobile responsiveness
- [x] Ensure alignment works on smaller screens
- [x] Adjust mobile-specific styles if needed
- [x] Test responsive behavior

### Step 4: Test and validate
- [x] Test with short and long program names
- [x] Verify column alignment is consistent
- [x] Check mobile device compatibility
- [x] Update test file if needed

### Step 5: Documentation
- [x] Update implementation documentation
- [x] Clean up test files
- [x] Mark tasks as complete

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED

The program order inputs alignment has been successfully implemented and tested. All order inputs now form a consistent column on the right-hand side of the program selector section, maintaining perfect alignment regardless of program name length or text wrapping.

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:
1. `assets/css/base.css` - Main container and label styles
2. `assets/css/pages/report-generator.css` - Program selector specific styles and mobile responsiveness
3. `test_program_names.html` - Enhanced test file with debug tools

### Key Changes Made:

#### 1. Program Container Layout (`base.css`)
```css
.program-checkbox-container {
    display: flex;
    align-items: flex-start;
    justify-content: space-between;
    gap: 0.5rem;
    min-width: 0;
    padding: 0.5rem;
}
```

#### 2. Order Input Consistency
- Unified width: 60px across all contexts
- Removed conflicting width definitions (70px !important)
- Added `flex-shrink: 0` to prevent input compression
- Ensured `program-order-container` matches input width (60px)

#### 3. Mobile Responsiveness (`report-generator.css`)
- Maintained 60px width on mobile (changed from 50px)
- Consistent font-size: 0.85rem (improved from 0.8rem)
- Proper gap spacing maintained

#### 4. Text Wrapping Support
- `white-space: normal` allows text to wrap
- `word-wrap: break-word` and `overflow-wrap: break-word` handle long words
- Flex layout ensures inputs stay aligned regardless of text length

### CSS Approach:
Used flexbox with `justify-content: space-between` to create consistent column alignment while maintaining text wrapping capability. The key insight was ensuring fixed widths for both the input and its container, combined with `flex-shrink: 0` to prevent compression.

### Test Results:
✅ **Alignment**: All order inputs form a perfect vertical column on the right
✅ **Text Wrapping**: Long program names wrap properly without affecting alignment  
✅ **Consistency**: Uniform spacing between text and inputs regardless of text length
✅ **Mobile**: Professional appearance maintained on both desktop and mobile
✅ **Debug Tools**: Added visual debugging aids for future maintenance
