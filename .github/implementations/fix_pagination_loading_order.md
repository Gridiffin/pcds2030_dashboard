# Fix Pagination Loading Order Issue

## Problem
The `view_programs.js` file was trying to use the `TablePagination` class before the `pagination.js` file was loaded, causing a `ReferenceError: TablePagination is not defined` error.

## Root Cause
- JavaScript files were being loaded in the wrong order
- `view_programs.js` was loaded before `pagination.js`
- No proper error handling for missing dependencies

## Solution
1. ✅ Reorder script loading in PHP file to load utilities first
2. ✅ Add proper error handling and fallback loading mechanism
3. ✅ Add debugging console logs for troubleshooting

## Files Modified
- ✅ `app/views/agency/programs/view_programs.php` - Reordered script loading
- ✅ `assets/js/agency/view_programs.js` - Added error handling and fallback loading

## Implementation Details

### Script Loading Order
Changed from:
```php
$additionalScripts = [
    APP_URL . '/assets/js/agency/view_programs.js',
    APP_URL . '/assets/js/utilities/table_sorting.js',
    APP_URL . '/assets/js/utilities/pagination.js'
];
```

To:
```php
$additionalScripts = [
    APP_URL . '/assets/js/utilities/table_sorting.js',
    APP_URL . '/assets/js/utilities/pagination.js',
    APP_URL . '/assets/js/agency/view_programs.js'
];
```

### Error Handling
Added check for `TablePagination` availability:
```javascript
if (typeof TablePagination !== 'undefined') {
    initializePagination();
} else {
    // Wait for TablePagination to be loaded
    const checkForTablePagination = setInterval(() => {
        if (typeof TablePagination !== 'undefined') {
            clearInterval(checkForTablePagination);
            initializePagination();
        }
    }, 100);
}
```

## Expected Outcome
- ✅ No more `TablePagination is not defined` errors
- ✅ Pagination works correctly on page load
- ✅ Proper error handling for missing dependencies
- ✅ Better debugging with console logs

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE
