# Fix Navbar Tab Positioning Issue

## Problem
The navigation tabs in both admin and agency navbars have positioning issues where they appear too off-centered. The tabs need to be shifted slightly to the right to improve visual balance.

## Analysis
- Both admin and agency navbars use `.navbar-nav.mx-auto` class to center the navigation items
- The issue is likely caused by uneven spacing between the brand (left) and right-side elements
- The centering calculation doesn't account for the different widths of left vs right elements
- Need to adjust the positioning to create better visual balance

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Identify Current Navigation Structure
- [x] Both navbars use Bootstrap's flexbox layout with:
  - `.navbar-brand` on the left
  - `.navbar-nav.mx-auto` for centered navigation items  
  - `.d-flex.ms-auto` for right-aligned elements (reports, settings, user info, logout)

### Step 2: Create CSS Adjustments
- [x] Add specific positioning adjustments for the centered navigation
- [x] Use margin or padding adjustments to shift tabs slightly right
- [x] Ensure the fix works for both admin and agency layouts
- [x] Test responsive behavior on different screen sizes

### Step 3: Test the Changes
- [x] Verify admin navigation positioning
- [x] Verify agency navigation positioning  
- [x] Test on different screen sizes
- [x] Ensure no other layout elements are affected

## Files to Modify
- `assets/css/layout/navigation.css` - Main navigation styling adjustments

## Implementation Notes
- The fix should be subtle - just enough to improve visual balance
- Must maintain responsive behavior
- Should work for both admin and agency navigation layouts

## Changes Made
1. **Added transform adjustment** - Used `transform: translateX()` to shift navigation tabs slightly to the right
2. **Responsive breakpoints** - Different shift amounts for different screen sizes:
   - Large screens (1200px+): 25px shift
   - Medium screens (992px-1199px): 15px shift  
   - Mobile (<992px): No shift (reset to normal)
3. **Preserved existing functionality** - All dropdown menus, hover effects, and responsive behavior maintained

## Result
The navigation tabs now appear better centered visually, accounting for the different widths of left-side brand and right-side elements (reports, settings, user info, logout button).
