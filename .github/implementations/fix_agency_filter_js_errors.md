# Fix JavaScript Errors After Agency Filter Refactoring - COMPLETED

## Overview
✅ **COMPLETED** - Fixed JavaScript errors caused by references to removed agency select elements after implementing the integrated agency filtering system.

## Issues Identified
- ✅ `agencySelect is not defined` error in loadPrograms function
- ✅ `toggleResetAgencyButton is not defined` error
- ✅ References to old agency dropdown elements that no longer exist

## COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION

### Phase 1: Fix Variable References
- [x] Remove references to `agencySelect` in loadPrograms function
- [x] Remove `toggleResetAgencyButton` function calls
- [x] Clean up any remaining old agency filter references

### Phase 2: Update Event Handlers
- [x] Update sector change event to work without agency select
- [x] Ensure all filter functions work with new integrated system
- [x] Test all filtering functionality

## Technical Fixes Applied

### JavaScript Errors Fixed
1. **loadPrograms Function (Line 126)**
   - Removed references to `agencySelect` variable
   - Updated function to work with new client-side agency filtering
   - Agency filtering now handled entirely on the frontend

2. **toggleResetAgencyButton Call (Line 1070)**
   - Removed call to non-existent `toggleResetAgencyButton()` function
   - This function was part of the old agency dropdown system

3. **File Structure**
   - Fixed DOMContentLoaded function closure
   - Ensured proper variable scoping

### Code Changes
```javascript
// Before (causing errors):
let agencyIds = [];
if (agencySelect) {
    agencyIds = Array.from(agencySelect.selectedOptions).map(opt => opt.value).filter(Boolean);
}
toggleResetAgencyButton();

// After (fixed):
// Note: Agency filtering is now handled on the client-side with integrated buttons
// No need to pass agency IDs to the API anymore
```

## Verification
- ✅ No JavaScript console errors
- ✅ Page loads without issues
- ✅ All filtering functionality works as expected
- ✅ Agency filter buttons work properly

The JavaScript errors have been successfully resolved and the integrated agency filtering system is now fully functional.
