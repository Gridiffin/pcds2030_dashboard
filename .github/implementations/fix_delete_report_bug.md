# Fix Delete Report Functionality in Pagination System

## Problem Description
When trying to delete a report in the paginated reports section, the following error occurs:
```
Error deleting report: Error: Invalid report ID
```

The error is happening in the `handleDeleteReport` function in `reports-pagination.js` at line 201, suggesting the report ID is not being properly retrieved or passed.

## Root Cause Analysis
- [x] Check how report IDs are being stored in the HTML data attributes ✅ HTML structure is correct
- [x] Verify the delete button event listener is correctly reading the report ID ✅ Added debugging
- [x] Examine the API endpoint for report deletion ✅ Found JSON vs form data issue
- [x] Ensure the modal is correctly populated with report information ✅ Working correctly

## Solution Steps
- [x] Inspect the current HTML structure for report cards and delete buttons ✅ 
- [x] Debug the JavaScript event handling for delete buttons ✅ Added console logs
- [x] Fix any issues with data attribute reading ✅ Added validation
- [x] Verify the delete API endpoint is working correctly ✅ Fixed JSON data handling
- [x] Test the complete delete workflow ⏳ Ready for testing

## Issues Found & Fixed
1. **API Data Format Mismatch**: The delete API was expecting form data (`$_POST`) but JavaScript was sending JSON data
   - **Fix**: Updated API to handle both JSON and form data
   
2. **Missing Error Validation**: No validation for invalid report IDs
   - **Fix**: Added comprehensive validation and debugging logs
   
3. **URL Configuration**: Hardcoded APP_URL usage
   - **Fix**: Added proper URL configuration using ReportGeneratorConfig

## Files Modified
1. ✅ `/app/api/delete_report.php` - Fixed JSON data handling
2. ✅ `/assets/js/admin/reports-pagination.js` - Added debugging and validation
3. ✅ URL configuration improvements

## Files to Check/Modify
1. `/app/views/admin/ajax/recent_reports_paginated.php` - HTML structure
2. `/assets/js/admin/reports-pagination.js` - Event handling
3. `/app/api/delete_report.php` - API endpoint
4. Modal handling in the main page

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Delete button clicks properly capture report ID
- [ ] Modal displays correct report information
- [ ] API call sends valid report ID
- [ ] Report is actually deleted from database
- [ ] UI updates correctly after deletion
