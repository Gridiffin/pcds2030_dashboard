# Dynamic Recent Reports Update Implementation

## Problem Description
Currently, after generating a PPTX report, users need to manually refresh the page to see the latest report in the recent reports list. This creates a poor user experience and feels outdated.

## Analysis
- **Current Issue**: Recent reports list is static and only updates on page refresh
- **Location**: Generate reports page likely has a recent reports section
- **Need**: Dynamic update of recent reports list after successful report generation
- **Technology**: AJAX/JavaScript to fetch and update the list without page refresh

## Solution Approach
Implement a real-time update system that:
1. Detects when a new report is generated successfully
2. Automatically fetches the updated recent reports list
3. Updates the UI without requiring a page refresh
4. Provides visual feedback during the update process

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Analyze Current Structure
- [x] Examine the generate reports page structure
- [x] Identify the recent reports display component
- [x] Check existing JavaScript for report generation
- [x] Locate the backend endpoint for recent reports data

### Step 2: Create Dynamic Update System
- [ ] Fix the existing AJAX endpoint for recent reports
- [ ] Modify report generation success callback to use correct path
- [ ] Implement proper JavaScript function to refresh recent reports list
- [ ] Add loading indicators and smooth transitions

### Step 3: Enhance User Experience
- [ ] Add visual feedback during report generation
- [ ] Show loading state while updating recent reports
- [ ] Add success notification with updated list
- [ ] Handle error scenarios gracefully

### Step 4: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test report generation and list update
- [ ] Verify no page refresh is needed
- [ ] Test with multiple consecutive report generations
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling

## Technical Requirements
- JavaScript/AJAX for dynamic updates
- Backend endpoint for recent reports data
- Smooth UI transitions
- Error handling and user feedback
- Consistent with existing code style

## Files to Modify
- Generate reports page (JavaScript)
- Recent reports AJAX endpoint
- CSS for loading states and transitions
- Any related report generation handlers

## Success Criteria
- Recent reports list updates automatically after report generation
- No manual page refresh required
- Smooth user experience with proper feedback
- Consistent with existing UI patterns
