# Fix Button Styling Consistency for Add Column/Row Buttons

## Problem Analysis
The "Add Column" and "Add Row" buttons in both admin and agency edit outcome pages have inconsistent styling:
- Add Column: `btn-primary` (blue)
- Add Row: `btn-success` (green)

This creates visual inconsistency since both buttons perform similar table manipulation functions.

## Solution Implementation

### ✅ Phase 1: Analyze Current Styling
- [x] **Task 1.1**: Check current button styles in admin edit outcome
- [x] **Task 1.2**: Check current button styles in agency edit outcome  
- [x] **Task 1.3**: Verify both have the same inconsistency

### ✅ Phase 2: Determine Consistent Style
- [x] **Task 2.1**: Review project design patterns for button groups
- [x] **Task 2.2**: Choose appropriate consistent style for both buttons
- [x] **Task 2.3**: Decide on btn-primary for both (blue) as primary table manipulation actions

### ✅ Phase 3: Update Admin Edit Outcome
- [x] **Task 3.1**: Update Add Row button to use btn-primary instead of btn-success
- [x] **Task 3.2**: Verify visual consistency after change

### ✅ Phase 4: Update Agency Edit Outcome  
- [x] **Task 4.1**: Update Add Row button to use btn-primary instead of btn-success
- [x] **Task 4.2**: Verify visual consistency after change

### ✅ Phase 5: Testing and Validation
- [x] **Task 5.1**: Test button functionality remains unchanged
- [x] **Task 5.2**: Verify visual consistency across both pages
- [x] **Task 5.3**: Check responsive behavior

## Design Decision
**Use `btn-primary` for both buttons** because:
1. Both are primary table manipulation actions
2. Primary blue is the standard action color in Bootstrap
3. Maintains consistency with other primary actions in the project
4. Green (success) is typically reserved for save/submit actions

## Files to Modify
- `app/views/admin/outcomes/edit_outcome.php`
- `app/views/agency/outcomes/edit_outcomes.php`

## Expected Changes
- Both Add Column and Add Row buttons will use consistent blue (btn-primary) styling
- Visual harmony in the button group
- Maintained functionality with improved UI consistency
