# Fix: Delete User Path Issue ✅ COMPLETED

## Problem Description
The delete user button redirects to a non-existent path:
- **Current (incorrect)**: `http://localhost/pcds2030_dashboard/app/views/handlers/admin/process_user.php?action=delete_user&user_id=44`
- **Expected (correct)**: `http://localhost/pcds2030_dashboard/app/handlers/admin/process_user.php?action=delete_user&user_id=44`

The issue is that the path includes `/views/handlers/` instead of just `/handlers/`.

## Root Cause ✅ IDENTIFIED
Found the issue in `app/views/admin/users/manage_users.php` line 237:
```php
header('Location: ../../handlers/admin/process_user.php?action=delete_user&user_id=' . $_POST['user_id']);
```

The relative path `../../handlers/admin/process_user.php` from `/app/views/admin/users/manage_users.php` incorrectly resolves to `/app/views/handlers/admin/process_user.php`.

## Solution ✅ IMPLEMENTED
**Fixed relative path in manage_users.php:**
- **Before**: `../../handlers/admin/process_user.php` 
- **After**: `../../../handlers/admin/process_user.php`

The correct path goes up three levels:
1. `../` from `users/` to `admin/`
2. `../` from `admin/` to `views/`
3. `../` from `views/` to `app/`
4. Then `handlers/admin/process_user.php`

## Changes Made
**File**: `app/views/admin/users/manage_users.php`
- **Line**: ~237 (in delete_user case)
- **Change**: Updated relative path from `../../` to `../../../`

```php
// Before:
header('Location: ../../handlers/admin/process_user.php?action=delete_user&user_id=' . $_POST['user_id']);

// After:
header('Location: ../../../handlers/admin/process_user.php?action=delete_user&user_id=' . $_POST['user_id']);
```

## Verification ✅ TESTED
- Created test script to verify path resolution
- Confirmed new path correctly resolves to `/app/handlers/admin/process_user.php`
- Confirmed the target file exists at the correct location
- Cleaned up test file after verification

## Path Resolution Details
From current location: `/app/views/admin/users/manage_users.php`
- **Old path**: `../../handlers/admin/process_user.php` → `/app/views/handlers/admin/process_user.php` ❌
- **New path**: `../../../handlers/admin/process_user.php` → `/app/handlers/admin/process_user.php` ✅

## Impact
- Delete user functionality now redirects to the correct handler
- Fixes 404 errors when attempting to delete users
- Maintains consistency with project structure where handlers are in `/app/handlers/`

## Related Issues
This fix completes the path correction issues in the PCDS2030 Dashboard:
1. ✅ Add User redirect path (fixed)
2. ✅ SQL syntax errors in Add User (fixed)  
3. ✅ Delete User path issue (fixed)

## Testing Recommendation
Test the delete user functionality in the admin panel to ensure:
- Delete button redirects to correct handler
- User deletion completes successfully
- No 404 errors occur
