# Agency Program View Attachments Implementation

## Problem
The agency-side program view page doesn't show attachment files, while the admin side does. Agencies should be able to view their own program attachments when viewing program details.

## Requirements
- Agency users should see attachments in their program view page
- Display attachment information (filename, size, upload date, etc.)
- Provide download functionality for their own attachments
- Follow the same design pattern as implemented for admin side
- Maintain agency permission restrictions (own programs only)

## Investigation Steps
- [ ] Examine current agency program view structure
- [ ] Check if program attachments library is included
- [ ] Identify where to add attachment section
- [ ] Verify agency permissions for attachment access
- [ ] Follow admin implementation pattern

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Backend Integration
- [ ] Add program attachments library inclusion to agency view program page
- [ ] Add code to fetch program attachments using existing functions
- [ ] Verify agency permission system works with attachments

### Phase 2: Frontend Integration
- [ ] Copy attachment section implementation from admin view
- [ ] Adapt styling to match agency interface design
- [ ] Ensure download functionality works for agencies
- [ ] Add attachment metadata display

### Phase 3: Styling & UI
- [ ] Check if agency-specific CSS is needed
- [ ] Ensure responsive design works
- [ ] Match existing agency UI patterns
- [ ] Test file type icons and formatting

## Files to Examine/Modify
- Agency program view page
- Agency CSS files (if needed)
- Existing attachment library (should already support agency access)

## Expected Outcome
- Agencies can view their own program attachments
- Same functionality as admin side but with agency permissions
- Consistent UI with existing agency interface
- Secure download functionality
