# Comprehensive Debug: Page Load Failure Investigation

## Problem Description
Despite fixing the include path issues, the manage_outcomes.php page still cannot load:
- Page doesn't display anything
- PHP errors show nothing
- Browser console shows nothing
- Previous fixes didn't resolve the loading issue

## Root Cause Analysis Strategy

### Step 1: Basic Connectivity and File Access
- [ ] Verify web server is running and accessible
- [ ] Test if other admin pages load correctly
- [ ] Check file permissions and accessibility
- [ ] Verify the exact URL being accessed

### Step 2: PHP Execution Testing
- [ ] Test direct PHP execution from command line
- [ ] Create minimal test version to isolate issues
- [ ] Check for silent PHP errors or warnings
- [ ] Verify PHP configuration and error reporting

### Step 3: Include Dependencies Analysis
- [ ] Verify all required files exist and are accessible
- [ ] Check for circular dependencies or include loops
- [ ] Test each include file individually
- [ ] Verify database connectivity and functions

### Step 4: Session and Authentication Testing
- [ ] Check if admin authentication is blocking access
- [ ] Test session management functionality
- [ ] Verify redirect behavior and login requirements

### Step 5: HTML/Browser Output Analysis
- [ ] Check for blank output vs error pages
- [ ] Test with different browsers
- [ ] Examine HTTP response headers
- [ ] Check for JavaScript conflicts

## Diagnostic Tools and Tests

### Test 1: Server Connectivity
- [ ] Test basic web server response
- [ ] Verify other pages in the same directory load

### Test 2: PHP Execution
- [ ] Create minimal PHP test file
- [ ] Test command-line PHP execution
- [ ] Check PHP error logs

### Test 3: Dependencies
- [ ] Test each include file separately
- [ ] Verify database functions work
- [ ] Check admin authentication

### Test 4: Progressive Testing
- [ ] Start with minimal PHP and gradually add functionality
- [ ] Identify which component causes the failure

## Expected Outcomes
- Identify the exact point of failure
- Isolate whether it's PHP, includes, database, or authentication
- Provide clear next steps for resolution
