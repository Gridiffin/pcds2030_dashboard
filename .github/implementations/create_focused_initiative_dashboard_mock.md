# Create Initiative-Focused Progress Dashboard Mock

## Objective
Create a focused initiative progress dashboard that only shows data directly related to initiatives and their linked programs, avoiding general system metrics that aren't initiative-specific.

## Tasks
- [x] Remove general system metrics (total submissions, audit logs, etc.)
- [x] Focus only on initiative-specific data
- [x] Show only programs linked to initiatives
- [x] Display initiative completion progress based on linked programs
- [x] Show initiative-program relationship clearly
- [x] Timeline focused on initiative duration and milestones
- [x] Activity feed showing only initiative-related actions
- [x] Progress charts showing initiative program completion
- [x] Calendar showing initiative-specific deadlines and milestones

## Initiative-Specific Data Included:
- [x] Initiative metadata (name, number, dates, status)
- [x] Linked programs count and status (2 programs linked to Initiative #31)
- [x] Initiative timeline progress (2021-2030, 45% complete)
- [x] Program completion rates within the initiative (50% on track)
- [x] Initiative-specific milestones and deadlines
- [x] Activity feed for initiative and its programs only
- [x] Progress distribution of programs within the initiative

## Data Excluded:
- [x] System-wide submission counts
- [x] General audit log entries
- [x] Non-initiative programs
- [x] Overall system metrics
- [x] User activity not related to this initiative

## Implemented Focus Areas:
1. **✅ Initiative Overview**: Biodiversity Conservation Initiative #31 details
2. **✅ Linked Programs**: Only 2 programs assigned to this initiative (261, 262)
3. **✅ Initiative Progress**: 10-year timeline from 2021-2030, currently 45% complete
4. **✅ Program Status**: Individual completion status for each initiative program
5. **✅ Initiative Activity**: Actions related specifically to this initiative and its programs
6. **✅ Initiative Calendar**: Deadlines and milestones specific to this initiative

## Key Improvements Made:
- **Focused Title**: Changed to "Biodiversity Conservation Initiative Progress"
- **Initiative-Specific Metrics**: Linked programs, program submissions, initiative timeline, programs on track
- **Program Details**: Individual cards for each linked program with their specific progress
- **Initiative Timeline**: Visual progress showing initiative duration and milestones
- **Focused Activity Feed**: Only shows activities related to this initiative and its programs
- **Initiative Calendar**: Shows initiative-specific milestones and program deadlines
- **Program Status Chart**: Distribution of the 2 programs within the initiative (50% on track, 50% getting started)
