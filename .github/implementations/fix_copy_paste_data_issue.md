# Fix Copy-Paste Data Issue in Program Creation

## Problem Description

When users create a program by copy-pasting their data into the fields, report generation cannot read its data properly.

## Analysis Results

- [x] Examined the current create_program.php form processing
- [x] Checked how data is saved to the database
- [x] Investigated report generation system to understand how it reads data
- [x] Identified potential issues with copy-pasted data (encoding, special characters, formatting)
- [x] Reviewed data sanitization and validation processes

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue stems from insufficient data sanitization when users copy-paste content, leading to:

1. **Hidden Unicode Characters**: Copy-pasted text often contains invisible characters (like non-breaking spaces, zero-width characters, etc.)
2. **Inconsistent Line Breaks**: Different sources use different line break formats (\r\n, \n, \r)
3. **Special Characters**: Smart quotes, em-dashes, and other special typography
4. **Encoding Issues**: Different character encodings from various sources
5. **Whitespace Issues**: Leading/trailing spaces and irregular whitespace

## Current Data Flow Issues

- `trim()` is used but doesn't handle all whitespace characters
- `htmlspecialchars()` handles HTML but not Unicode issues
- Report generation expects clean, consistent text format
- JSON encoding/decoding doesn't normalize Unicode

## Solution Implementation

- [x] Add comprehensive data sanitization functions
- [x] Implement Unicode normalization
- [x] Apply sanitization to create_program.php (agency)
- [x] Apply sanitization to update_program.php (agency)
- [x] Apply sanitization to edit_program.php (admin)
- [x] Test sanitization functions with various copy-paste scenarios
- [ ] Test report generation with cleaned data
- [ ] Add validation feedback to users

## Testing Plan

- [x] Test with various copy-paste sources (Word, PDF, web pages, Unicode characters)
- [x] Verify sanitization functions work correctly
- [ ] Test with special characters and formatting in live environment
- [ ] Validate data integrity in database
- [ ] Verify report generation works correctly

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified:

1. `app/lib/functions.php` - Added `sanitize_copy_paste_content()` and `sanitize_program_data()` functions
2. `app/views/agency/programs/create_program.php` - Applied sanitization to all form processing
3. `app/views/agency/programs/update_program.php` - Applied sanitization to all form processing
4. `app/views/admin/programs/edit_program.php` - Applied sanitization to all form processing

### Sanitization Features:

- Unicode normalization (if Normalizer class available)
- Smart quotes conversion to regular quotes
- Em/en dash conversion to regular hyphens
- Zero-width character removal
- Non-breaking space normalization
- Line break normalization
- Excessive whitespace cleanup
- Control character removal

### Test Results:

- ✅ Smart quotes properly converted
- ✅ Unicode spaces normalized to regular spaces
- ✅ Em/en dashes converted to hyphens
- ✅ Zero-width characters removed
- ✅ Line breaks normalized and excessive breaks reduced
- ✅ Ellipsis converted to three dots
- ✅ Nested array sanitization working (targets, etc.)
- ✅ Multiline field preservation working correctly
