# Enhance Edit History - Comprehensive Change Tracking and Pagination

## Problem
The current edit history "Changes" column only records changes to rating and targets. It should track ALL changes made to the program, including:
- Program name changes
- Program number changes  
- Agency/owner changes
- Sector changes
- Date changes
- Brief description changes
- Edit permissions changes
- Assignment status changes

Additionally, the edit history needs pagination to handle many entries efficiently.

## Solution
1. **Enhanced Change Tracking**: Create a comprehensive diff system that compares all fields between submissions
2. **Better Change Display**: Show meaningful change descriptions for all program fields
3. **Pagination System**: Implement pagination for the edit history table
4. **Performance Optimization**: Efficient querying and display of large edit histories

## Tasks
- [ ] Research current program submission data structure
- [ ] Create comprehensive change detection system
- [ ] Enhance the Changes column display logic
- [ ] Add pagination to edit history table
- [ ] Update the program history query to support pagination
- [ ] Add pagination controls (Previous/Next, Page numbers)
- [ ] Test with large edit histories

## Implementation Details
- Analyze all program fields that can change
- Create diff comparison function for program data
- Implement pagination with configurable page size
- Add LIMIT and OFFSET to SQL queries
- Create pagination UI components
- Ensure proper sorting by submission date

## Files to Modify
- `app/views/admin/programs/edit_program.php` (main display logic)
- `app/lib/agencies/programs.php` (if history function is there)
- Add pagination styles if needed
