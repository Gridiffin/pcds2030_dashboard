# Overhaul Admin Outcomes Section

## Goal
Make the admin-side outcomes management work exactly like the agency side, but retain admin-specific features (e.g., resubmit and submit buttons).

## Steps

- [x] 1. Analyze the current admin outcomes management file and the agency-side equivalent.
- [x] 2. List all differences in logic, UI, and flow between the two implementations.
- [x] 3. Identify and document admin-specific features (e.g., resubmit, submit buttons).
- [x] 4. Plan how to merge agency-side logic/UI into the admin file, preserving admin features.
- [x] 5. Refactor the admin outcomes management file to match the agency side's structure and flow.
- [x] 6. Integrate admin-specific controls (resubmit, submit) into the new structure.
- [x] 7. Test the new implementation for both admin and agency roles.
- [x] 8. Clean up and document the code.
- [x] 9. Mark this checklist as complete and remove any test files created during the process.
