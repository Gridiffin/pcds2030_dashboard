# Gantt Chart Enhancement: Hierarchical View

This document outlines the plan to enhance the Gantt chart on the initiative progress dashboard. The goal is to replace the current high-level chart with a detailed, hierarchical, grid-based view that aligns with the user-provided diagram.

## Key Features to Implement

-   **Hierarchical Structure**: Display the `Initiative > Program > Target` relationship.
-   **Grid-Based Timeline**: Show progress on a quarterly basis.
-   **Expandable Rows**: Allow users to expand programs to see their underlying targets.
-   **Status Indicators**: Use colors and icons to represent the status of each target per quarter (e.g., Completed, In Progress, Planned).
-   **Special Markers**: Include visual cues for milestones, hold points, and program completion dates.

## Implementation Plan

-   [x] **1. Create Implementation Plan**: Document the required features and steps.
-   [ ] **2. Restructure HTML**: Replace the existing Gantt chart container with a new structure suitable for a grid-based layout (e.g., a `div` to be populated by JavaScript). Add a legend to explain the new symbols and colors.
-   [ ] **3. Add Hierarchical Mock Data**: Create a new JavaScript data object that mirrors the structure from the user's diagram, including programs, targets, and their quarterly statuses.
-   [ ] **4. Develop JavaScript Rendering Logic**:
    -   Create a function to generate the timeline header (Years and Quarters).
    -   Create a function to render the program and target rows based on the mock data.
    -   Implement expand/collapse functionality for program rows.
    -   Render the status for each target in the quarterly cells.
    -   Place special markers (milestones, hold points) on the grid.
-   [ ] **5. Apply CSS Styling**:
    -   Style the grid layout, ensuring proper alignment and readability.
    -   Define styles for different cell statuses (e.g., `completed`, `in-progress`, `planned`).
    -   Style the hierarchical indentation for programs and targets.
    -   Ensure the new chart is responsive.
-   [ ] **6. Final Review**: Verify that the implementation matches the user's diagram and functions correctly.
