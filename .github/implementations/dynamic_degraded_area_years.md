# Dynamic Degraded Area Chart Years Implementation

## Problem
The Total Degraded Area chart currently uses hardcoded years (2022, 2023, 2024) instead of dynamically calculating the latest 3 years based on the current date.

## Current Issues
- Years are hardcoded in both PHP backend (`report_data.php`) and JavaScript frontend (`report-slide-styler.js`)
- Chart will become outdated as years progress
- Manual code updates required annually

## Solution
Modify the code to dynamically calculate the latest 3 years:
- Current year: 2025
- Previous year: 2024  
- Year before previous: 2023

## Implementation Steps

### [x] Step 1: Modify PHP Backend (`app/api/report_data.php`)
- [x] Replace hardcoded years array with dynamic calculation
- [x] Update degraded area data initialization
- [x] Update chart data preparation
- [x] Ensure backward compatibility with existing data

### [x] Step 2: Modify JavaScript Frontend (`assets/js/report-modules/report-slide-styler.js`)
- [x] Replace hardcoded `yearsToShow` array with dynamic calculation
- [x] Update chart rendering logic
- [x] Ensure consistent year format between frontend and backend

### [x] Step 3: Testing
- [x] Test chart generation with new dynamic years
- [x] Verify data integrity - Database confirmed 2025 data exists (partial year)
- [x] Check chart display and formatting  
- [x] Validate edge cases (missing data for certain years)
- [x] **Database Verification**: 2025 column exists with partial data (Jan-May have values, Jun-Dec are zeros)

### [x] Step 3.5: Implement Zero Value Support for Missing Years
- [x] Modify PHP backend to ensure all dynamic years are included in API response
- [x] Modify JavaScript frontend to show all years even with zero values
- [x] Test that 2025 appears with zero values if no data exists
- [x] Update error handling to account for guaranteed year inclusion
- [x] Add informative logging for missing data years

### [x] Step 4: Cleanup
- [x] Remove any test files
- [x] Update documentation if needed
- [x] **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: 2025 data is showing but appears flat due to small values compared to 2023/2024 scale

## **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE ✅**

The original goal has been successfully achieved:
- ✅ Dynamic years (2023, 2024, 2025) instead of hardcoded (2022, 2023, 2024)
- ✅ 2025 data is appearing in the chart
- ✅ Zero value support implemented for missing years
- ✅ Future-proof implementation that updates automatically

## **Visual Issue Noted (Not Addressed)**
The 2025 line appears flat on the x-axis due to scale difference:
- 2025 values: ~127 Ha max
- 2024 values: ~7,000 Ha max
- Chart scaling makes 2025 barely visible

**Note**: This is a visualization scaling issue, not a data issue. The implementation works correctly.

## Files to Modify
1. `app/api/report_data.php` - Backend data processing
2. `assets/js/report-modules/report-slide-styler.js` - Frontend chart rendering

## Expected Outcome
- Chart will automatically show latest 3 years (2023, 2024, 2025) without code changes
- Future-proof implementation that updates automatically each year
- Cleaner, more maintainable code
