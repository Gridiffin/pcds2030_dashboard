## Remaining Restructuring

### ðŸ”„ Next Targets (In Priority Order)

1. **Programs View** (`view_programs.php`)
   - Move to `/app/views/agency/programs/view_programs.php`
   - Check for related AJAX files

2. **Program Management** 
   - `create_program.php` â†’ `programs/create_program.php`
   - `edit_program.php` â†’ `programs/edit_program.php`
   - `program_details.php` â†’ `programs/program_details.php`

3. **Metrics/Outcomes Management**
   - Group metrics-related files into `metrics/` or `outcomes/`
   - Examples: `submit_metrics.php`, `view_metric.php`, etc.

4. **Reports and Notifications**
   - Group into `reports/` and `notifications/` directories

## Pattern Established

### Directory Structure Pattern
```
/app/views/agency/[component]/
â”œâ”€â”€ [main_view].php
â”œâ”€â”€ [create_view].php (if applicable)
â”œâ”€â”€ [edit_view].php (if applicable)
â””â”€â”€ ajax/
    â””â”€â”€ [component]_data.php
```

### Update Checklist Per Component
- [ ] Create directory structure
- [ ] Move main files
- [ ] Move related AJAX files
- [ ] Update PROJECT_ROOT_PATH for new depth
- [ ] Fix layout include paths
- [ ] Update navigation references
- [ ] Update internal file references
- [ ] Update JavaScript endpoints

## Current Status
- **2/7 major components restructured** 
- **Pattern well-established and proven**
- **Ready to continue with programs component**

## Tools and Techniques Used
- `PROJECT_ROOT_PATH` constant for reliable includes
- `__DIR__` relative paths for AJAX files
