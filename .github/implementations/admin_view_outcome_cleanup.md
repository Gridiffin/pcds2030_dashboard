# Clean Up Admin View Outcome Page

## Problem Description
The admin view_outcome.php page still contains outdated elements that should be removed:

1. **Unused Badges**: Reporting period badges and sector badges are still displayed
2. **Status Badges**: Status badges that are no longer needed 
3. **Sector/Period Information**: Any sector and reporting period information should be removed from the page display
4. **Chart Data Issue**: Data from database is not being pushed into the chart view properly

## Root Cause Analysis
After removing draft/submitted logic and updating the data structure parsing, some display elements were not updated to match the new simplified approach. The page still shows:
- Period badges (Q2 2025, etc.)
- Sector badges (Forestry, etc.) 
- Status badges (submission status)
- Sector and period information in the details section

Also, the chart initialization may not be receiving the properly formatted data.
