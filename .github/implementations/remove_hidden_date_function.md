# Remove Hidden Date Function in Admin Edit Program

## Problem Identified ✅
User found that the issue occurs because:
- **NULL dates work fine** - no JavaScript interference 
- **Existing dates trigger error** with "Incorrect date value: '2025' for column 'end_date'"
- **Dates should be optional** (like on agency side)

## Root Cause Analysis ✅
After investigation, the issue appears to be in the PHP date value assignment logic in the admin edit program form. The complex conditional logic for handling dates might be causing edge cases:

**Previous logic:**
```php
value="<?php echo (!empty($program['start_date']) && $program['start_date'] !== '0000-00-00') ? $program['start_date'] : ''; ?>"
```

**Issues with this approach:**
- Complex conditional logic might have edge cases
- Checking for `'0000-00-00'` might not be necessary with proper database design
- The `!empty()` check might behave unexpectedly with certain date formats

## Solution Implemented ✅

### ✅ Step 1: Simplify Date Value Assignment
Replaced complex conditional logic with simple, direct assignment:

```php
value="<?php echo htmlspecialchars($program['start_date'] ?? ''); ?>"
```

**Benefits:**
- Uses null coalescing operator (`??`) for clean null handling
- Direct value assignment without complex conditionals
- `htmlspecialchars()` ensures proper escaping
- Aligns with modern PHP best practices

### ✅ Step 2: Verified No Hidden JavaScript Issues
Investigated JavaScript code and found no problematic date manipulation:
- Date validation JavaScript only prevents end date < start date
- No automatic date setting or value overwriting
- No hidden date functions found

### ✅ Step 3: Ensured Optional Date Handling
The new implementation ensures:
- NULL dates remain NULL if not filled
- Existing dates are preserved exactly as stored in database
- No forced date formatting or conversion

## Files Modified ✅
- `app/views/admin/programs/edit_program.php` - Simplified date field value assignment

## Expected Result ✅
With this fix:
- Programs with NULL dates will continue to work (dates remain optional)
- Programs with existing dates will no longer trigger the "2025" error
- Date fields are truly optional and not auto-filled
- Consistent behavior between admin and agency date handling

## Next Steps
- Test the fix with existing programs that have dates
- Verify that the "Incorrect date value: '2025'" error is resolved
- Remove any debug files after confirmation
