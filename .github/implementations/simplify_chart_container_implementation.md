# Chart Container Simplification Implementation

## Problem

The Chart.js chart in the agency outcome view was experiencing issues with sizing, responsiveness, and text scaling. The previous implementation had:

1. Overly complex sizing logic that caused rendering problems
2. Small container size that constrained the chart
3. Issues with text scaling and readability
4. Initialization issues when switching tabs

## Solution

We simplified the chart implementation with the following approach:

### 1. Use a Larger, Fixed Container Size

```php
<div class="chart-container" style="position: relative; width: 100%; height: 600px; padding: 20px; background: #fafafa; border-radius: 8px; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 20px;">
    <canvas id="metricChart"></canvas>
</div>
```

- Increased height to 600px (from 500px)
- Added proper margins and padding for better visual balance
- Retained 100% width to maintain responsiveness

### 2. Simplify Chart.js Initialization

- Removed unnecessary code that was manually setting canvas dimensions
- Let Chart.js handle the responsive behavior
- Fixed JavaScript syntax errors that were causing rendering issues

### 3. Improve Font Sizes and Styling

- Increased font size for axis labels from 11px to 13px
- Increased font weight from normal to 500 for better readability
- Increased title font size from 16px to 18px
- Improved tooltip display with larger fonts and better spacing

### 4. Enhance Chart Options

- Improved tooltip styling with better padding and contrast
- Enhanced legend display with more spacing and better visual cues
- Improved axis grid styling for better readability

### 5. Fix Tab Switching and Resizing Behavior

- Improved the chart initialization on tab switch
- Added proper debounce logic for window resize events
- Fixed event handlers to ensure Chart.js properly redraws on container size changes

## Results

The chart now:

1. Displays at an adequate size with proper text scaling
2. Is more visually balanced with better margins and padding
3. Has improved readability with larger fonts and better spacing
4. Renders correctly when switching between tabs
5. Resizes properly when the window size changes

This implementation follows the principle of simplicity by removing unnecessary complexity and letting the Chart.js library handle responsive behavior as it was designed to do.
