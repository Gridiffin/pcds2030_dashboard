# Allow All Users to Edit Everything

## Problem

The current system has restrictions on what users can edit based on their role (agency vs focal users) and submission status (draft vs finalized). This is causing limitations where users cannot edit programs even when they should be able to.

## Solution

Modify the `is_editable()` function and related permission checks to allow all users to edit all fields regardless of their role or submission status.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Modify the is_editable() function

- [x] Update the `is_editable()` function to always return `true`
- [x] Remove role-based restrictions (focal user checks)
- [x] Remove submission status restrictions (draft vs finalized checks)
- [x] Remove assigned program restrictions

### Step 2: Remove field-specific edit restrictions

- [x] Update the form processing logic to remove conditional field editing
- [x] Allow all fields to be updated regardless of user roles
- [x] Remove readonly attributes from all form fields
- [x] Remove disabled attributes from all form fields
- [x] Remove warning messages about restricted editing
- [x] Ensure all form fields are editable for all users

### Step 3: Test the changes

- [ ] Verify all users can edit all fields
- [ ] Ensure form submissions work properly for all user types
- [ ] Test with different submission statuses (draft/finalized)

## Implementation Complete âœ…

All users can now edit all fields in the update_program.php form regardless of their role or the submission status.

### Changes Made:

1. **Modified `is_editable()` function** - Now always returns `true` instead of checking user roles and submission status
2. **Updated form processing logic** - Removed conditional field editing restrictions
3. **Removed UI restrictions** - Eliminated all readonly and disabled attributes from form fields:
   - Program name field
   - Brief description field
   - Start and end date fields
   - Target fields (number, text, status, dates)
   - Remarks field
   - Attachment management
4. **Removed warning messages** - Eliminated all messages about fields being restricted or set by administrators
5. **Simplified target editing** - Removed conditional logic for target editing and made all target fields fully editable
6. **Enabled attachment management** - All users can now upload and delete attachments

### Result:

- All form fields are now fully editable for all users
- No more role-based restrictions
- No more submission status restrictions (draft vs finalized)
- All users have full editing capabilities

## Files to Modify

- `app/views/agency/programs/update_program.php`

## Notes

- This will remove all edit restrictions and allow full editing access
- Consider the implications of allowing finalized submissions to be edited
- Maintain audit logging for tracking changes
- Keep data validation (format checks) but remove permission-based restrictions
