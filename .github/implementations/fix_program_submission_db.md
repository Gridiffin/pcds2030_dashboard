# Fix: Program Submission Not Updating Database

## Problem

- When submitting a program, the UI shows "program submitted" but the database is not updated.
- Expected: Submitting a program should update the database (e.g., mark as finalized, save submission data) and only then show a success message.

## Solution Plan

- [x] 1. Document the problem and solution plan in this file.
- [x] 2. Trace the program submission flow:
  - Identified the JS and PHP endpoints involved in submitting a program.
  - Confirmed AJAX call to `submit_program.php` and DB logic in PHP.
- [ ] 3. Review the PHP handler:
  - Ensure it performs the correct database operation (insert/update).
  - Make sure it returns a proper response.
- [ ] 4. Update the handler if needed:
  - Add/modify the database logic to save the submission.
  - Use parameterized queries for security.
- [ ] 5. Test the fix:
  - Submit a program and verify the database is updated.
  - Ensure the UI message only appears after a successful DB operation.
- [ ] 6. Mark tasks as complete in this file.
- [ ] 7. Delete any test files if created.

**Next:**

- Improve error handling and user feedback in both PHP and JS.
- Ensure the UI only shows success if the DB operation is successful.
