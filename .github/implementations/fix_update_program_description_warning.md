# Fix: Undefined variable and deprecated htmlspecialchars() usage in update_program.php

## Problem
- PHP warning: Undefined variable `$brief_description` on line 646.
- Deprecated warning: `htmlspecialchars()` called with null value for `$brief_description`.
- Brief Description field does not show value from SQL table if not present in latest submission.

## Solution Steps
- [x] Ensure `$brief_description` is always defined before use (default to empty string if not set).
- [x] Update the code to safely use `htmlspecialchars()` only with a string value.
- [x] Add fallback: if `$brief_description` is empty after checking submissions, use the value from the main program table (`brief_description` or `description`).
- [x] Test the update to confirm warnings are resolved and value is shown.

## Status
- [x] Problem identified
- [x] Solution planned
- [x] Implementation complete
- [x] Testing complete
