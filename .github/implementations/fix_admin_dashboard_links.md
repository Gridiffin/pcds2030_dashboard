# Fix Admin Dashboard Button and Link Redirections

## Problem Analysis

The admin dashboard contains several links and buttons that may not be redirecting correctly. We need to ensure all URLs are properly formed and working. 

Common issues to look for:
- Extra spaces or characters in the URLs
- Missing parameters
- Incorrect path construction
- Syntax errors in PHP URL generation code

## Areas to check in admin dashboard:

- [x] Quick Action buttons (Assign Programs, Open/Close Period, Generate Reports, Add New User)
  - Fixed extra `?> ?>` at the end of URLs in all four quick action buttons
- [x] Program Overview section links (View Assigned Programs, View Agency Programs)
  - No issues found with these links
- [x] Other action buttons or links on the dashboard
  - Fixed status badges that had extra `?>` tokens
  - Fixed percentage calculations that had extra `?>` tokens
  - Fixed formatting in the assigned programs alert link
- [ ] Navigation links in admin_nav.php (to be addressed separately)

## Implementation Plan

1. Check each link/button in the admin dashboard
2. Identify any issues with URL generation
3. Fix the issues one by one
4. Test each link after fixing

## Implementation

### Issues Fixed

1. **Quick Action Buttons**
   - Fixed URLs in all four quick action buttons that had extra `?> ?>` at the end
   - Affected buttons: Assign Programs, Open/Close Period, Generate Reports, Add New User

2. **Status Display Badges**
   - Fixed two instances of incorrect PHP syntax where an extra `?>` was appearing
   - This was causing text to be displayed instead of being interpreted as PHP

3. **Percentage Calculations**
   - Fixed two percentage calculation lines that had extra `?>` tokens
   - Line ~166: On Track Programs percentage display
   - Line ~189: Delayed Programs percentage display

4. **Alert Link**
   - Fixed formatting issue in the empty assigned programs alert link

### Testing Instructions

1. Login as admin and verify the dashboard loads correctly
2. Test each quick action button
3. Verify percentage values are displayed correctly
4. Test program overview links
