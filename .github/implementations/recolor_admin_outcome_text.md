## Plan: Recolor Admin Outcome Detail Text

- [x] **Locate Elements:** Found the HTML for "Created: May 9, 2025" and "Manage your existing outcome detail configurations" in `d:\\laragon\\www\\pcds2030_dashboard\\app\\views\\admin\\outcomes\\create_outcome_details.php`.
- [x] **Inspect Current Styling:** Identified `text-muted` as the class responsible for the low visibility.
- [x] **Identify Contrasting Color:** Decided to use `text-dark-emphasis` (a Bootstrap class).
- [x] **Apply New Styling:** Changed `text-muted` to `text-dark-emphasis` for the specified elements in `d:\\laragon\\www\\pcds2030_dashboard\\app\\views\\admin\\outcomes\\create_outcome_details.php`.
- [x] **Verify Changes:** Ensured the text is now clearly visible and the change doesn't negatively affect other parts of the page.
