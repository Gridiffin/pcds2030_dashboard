## Summary of Changes Made

### Delete Button Fixes:
1. **Fixed Database Query**: Updated delete_report.php to use proper JOINs with users and reporting_periods tables instead of non-existent columns
2. **Added Modal Triggers**: Added missing `data-bs-toggle="modal"` and `data-bs-target="#deleteReportModal"` attributes to all delete buttons
3. **Fixed Class Selector**: Updated JavaScript to look for `.delete-report-btn` instead of `.action-btn-delete`
4. **Improved Path Handling**: Enhanced file path construction to handle both old and new path formats

### Download Button Fixes:
1. **Enhanced Path Logic**: Modified download.php to handle full database paths (app/reports/pptx/filename.pptx)
2. **Maintained Security**: Kept basename() validation while supporting full paths from database
3. **Verified File Existence**: Confirmed that generated files exist and are accessible
