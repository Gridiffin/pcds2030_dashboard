# Footer Positioning Fix for update_program.php

## Issue Description
The footer was appearing in the middle of the page in `update_program.php` due to malformed HTML structure and incomplete form elements.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Incomplete JavaScript code** - Malformed event handlers and incomplete functions
2. **Missing form sections** - Missing remarks/comments card section
3. **Incomplete HTML structure** - Missing proper closing tags and container structure

### 3. Completed JavaScript Functionality

### 4. Enhanced Form Actions

## Code Structure Improvements

### Before (Issues)

    // ...incomplete code...
    return true;                        });
});                </script>
// Missing closing tags
```

### After (Fixed)

    // Add target functionality  
    // History toggle functionality
    // Form validation
    // All properly structured with complete handlers
});
</script>
```
