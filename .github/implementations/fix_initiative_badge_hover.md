# Fix Initiative Badge Hover Effect

## Problem Description
The initiative badges in the admin programs page use the `.initiative-name` CSS class which applies a white box hover effect. When hovering over the badge, both the badge background and text turn white, making the text unreadable and breaking the visual design.

## Current Issues
- ‚ùå Badge becomes unreadable (white text on white background) when hovered
- ‚ùå White box hover effect conflicts with badge styling

## Solution Overview
