# Fix Create Initiatives Page Footer Positioning

## Problem
The footer in the create initiatives page is appearing in the middle of the page, specifically within the initiative details section, instead of at the bottom of the page.

## Root Cause Analysis
Upon examining the code, I can see several HTML structure issues:

1. **Improper nesting of div elements** - The main content structure has incorrect div closures
2. **Missing proper container structure** - The layout is not following the established pattern
3. **Inconsistent column structure** - The row/column layout is not properly closed

## Solution Steps

### ✅ Step 1: Analyze Current Structure
- [x] Examine the create.php file structure
- [x] Check header.php and footer.php layout expectations
- [x] Identify the HTML nesting issues

### ✅ Step 2: Fix HTML Structure
- [x] Correct the main content container structure
- [x] Fix the row/column div closures
- [x] Ensure proper nesting of all elements
- [x] Follow the same pattern as other working admin pages

### ✅ Step 3: Validate Layout
- [x] Test the page in browser
- [x] Ensure footer appears at bottom
- [x] Verify responsive behavior
- [x] Check for any console errors

### ✅ Step 4: Clean Up
- [x] Remove any redundant or incorrect div elements
- [x] Ensure consistent indentation
- [x] Validate HTML structure
