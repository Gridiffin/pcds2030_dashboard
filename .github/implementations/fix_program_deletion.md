# Program Deletion Issue - Admin Side

## Problem Description
- When clicking the delete button on programs in the admin programs page, the page just refreshes
- No PHP error or console error is shown
- The program is not deleted

## Investigation Steps
1. âœ… Check the HTML structure of the delete button in programs.php
2. âœ… Verify JavaScript function `confirmDeleteProgram` exists in programs_admin.js
3. âœ… Confirm JavaScript file is loaded via $additionalScripts
4. âœ… Check if the delete_program.php file handles the request properly
5. âœ… Fixed file path and HTTP method issues
6. âœ… Verified PHP syntax is correct

## Issues Found & Fixed
1. **File Path Issues**: The `delete_program.php` was using incorrect include paths (`PROJECT_ROOT_PATH` pattern instead of the standard admin pattern)
2. **HTTP Method Mismatch**: JavaScript was making GET request but PHP expected POST with `confirm_delete` parameter

## Fixes Applied
1. âœ… **Fixed Include Paths**: Updated delete_program.php to use the correct include pattern matching other admin files:
   ```php
   require_once '../../../config/config.php';
   require_once ROOT_PATH . 'app/lib/db_connect.php';
   ```

2. âœ… **Fixed HTTP Method**: Updated JavaScript to create and submit a POST form with proper parameters:
   - `program_id` - The program to delete
   - `period_id` - Current period context
   - `confirm_delete` - Confirmation flag

## Testing Instructions
To test the fix:
1. Navigate to Admin > Programs
2. Click the delete button (trash icon) on any program
3. Confirm the deletion in the popup dialog
4. Verify the program is deleted and you're redirected back with a success message

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. **User clicks delete button** â†’ JavaScript shows confirmation dialog
2. **User confirms** â†’ JavaScript creates POST form and submits to delete_program.php
3. **PHP processes request** â†’ Deletes program and submissions from database
4. **Success** â†’ Redirects back to programs page with success message
5. **Audit log** â†’ Action is logged for security tracking

## Files Modified
- âœ… `/app/views/admin/programs/delete_program.php` - Fixed include paths
- âœ… `/assets/js/admin/programs_admin.js` - Fixed HTTP method and parameters

## Status
ðŸŸ¢ **COMPLETE** - Issues fixed and ready for testing
