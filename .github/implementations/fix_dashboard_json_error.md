# Fix for Dashboard JSON Parsing Error

## Problem Description
- Error: `SyntaxError: JSON.parse: unexpected character at line 1 column 1 of the JSON data dashboard.js:102:17`
- This error occurred in the agency dashboard when fetching dashboard data
- The issue was caused by an incorrect path to the AJAX endpoint, resulting in a 404 error which cannot be parsed as JSON

## Solution Steps

- [x] Identify the error source in `assets/js/agency/dashboard.js`
- [x] Analyze the current project structure to determine correct path to the AJAX endpoint
- [x] Update the fetch URL in the dashboard.js file from `../ajax/dashboard_data.php` to `../app/ajax/dashboard_data.php`
- [x] Document the fix for future reference

## Technical Details

The error occurred because the JavaScript was trying to access a file at `../ajax/dashboard_data.php` relative to the assets/js/agency directory, but the actual file is located at `app/ajax/dashboard_data.php` relative to the project root.

The fix properly aligns the path reference with the current project structure, which has the following organization:

```
pcds2030_dashboard/
├── assets/
│   └── js/
│       └── agency/
│           └── dashboard.js  
└── app/
    └── ajax/
        └── dashboard_data.php  (Target endpoint)
```

## Potential Further Improvements

1. Consider using a configuration file to store API endpoint paths
2. Implement proper error handling on the server-side to return meaningful JSON errors
3. Add more robust client-side error handling for better user feedback
