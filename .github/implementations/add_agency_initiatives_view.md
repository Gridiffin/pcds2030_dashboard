# Add Initiatives View Page for Agencies

## Problem
Agencies currently don't have a dedicated page to view initiatives they're involved with. They can only see initiative information within the context of their programs, which limits their understanding of the broader initiative scope and related programs from other agencies.

## Current State
- **Admin Side**: Has full initiatives management with create, edit, delete capabilities
- **Agency Side**: No initiatives page - only sees initiative info within program details
- **Need**: Read-only initiatives view for agencies showing initiatives they're involved with

## Proposed Solution
Create a read-only initiatives page for agencies that shows:
1. **Initiatives List**: Only initiatives that have programs assigned to their agency
2. **Initiative Details**: Complete information about each initiative
3. **Related Programs**: All programs under each initiative (cross-agency visibility for context)
4. **Filtering/Search**: To help agencies find specific initiatives
5. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface

## User Experience Design
- **Limited Access**: Agencies see only initiatives they're involved with (have programs assigned)
- **Read-Only**: No create, edit, or delete capabilities
- **Contextual Information**: Complete initiative details including description, timeline, and all related programs
- **Navigation**: Easy access from main agency navigation

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Analysis and Planning
- [x] Examine admin initiatives page structure (`app/views/admin/initiatives/`)
- [x] Identify what should be visible to agencies vs. admin-only features
- [x] Plan the agency-specific initiatives page layout and functionality
- [x] Design the navigation integration

### Step 2: Backend Development
- [x] Create agency-specific function to get initiatives with agency programs
- [x] Modify or create new functions for agency initiative access
- [x] Ensure proper permission checks and data filtering
- [x] Test database queries for performance

### Step 3: Frontend Development
- [x] Create `app/views/agency/initiatives/view_initiatives.php`
- [x] Design responsive layout for initiatives list and details
- [x] Implement search and filtering functionality
- [x] Add proper styling consistent with agency interface

### Step 4: Navigation Integration
- [x] Add "Initiatives" menu item to agency navigation
- [x] Update navigation styling and icons
- [x] Ensure proper active states and breadcrumbs

### Step 5: Testing and Refinement
- [x] Test with agencies that have multiple initiatives
- [x] Test with agencies that have no initiatives
- [x] Verify responsive design on mobile devices
- [x] Test search and filtering functionality
- [x] Ensure proper permission enforcement

## Expected Result âœ…
Agencies now have a comprehensive, read-only initiatives page that provides complete context about initiatives they're involved with, enhancing their understanding of the broader program landscape while maintaining appropriate access restrictions.
