# Fix Status Grid Header Alignment - Rowspan Issue

## Problem
The quarterly columns (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) are being generated incorrectly. The second header row is trying to include cells for ALL columns, but it should NOT include cells for the left panel columns since they use `rowspan="2"`.

## Current Issue:
The JavaScript is generating this:
```html
<tr>
  <th rowspan="2">Program #</th>
  <th rowspan="2">Program Name</th>
  <th colspan="4">2023</th>
  <th colspan="4">2024</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <th>Q1</th><th>Q2</th><th>Q3</th><th>Q4</th>  <!-- This is wrong! -->
  <th>Q1</th><th>Q2</th><th>Q3</th><th>Q4</th>
</tr>
```

## Correct Structure Should Be:
```html
<tr>
  <th rowspan="2">Program #</th>
  <th rowspan="2">Program Name</th>
  <th colspan="4">2023</th>
  <th colspan="4">2024</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <!-- NO cells for Program # and Name - they're already covered by rowspan -->
  <th>Q1</th><th>Q2</th><th>Q3</th><th>Q4</th>  <!-- Under 2023 -->
  <th>Q1</th><th>Q2</th><th>Q3</th><th>Q4</th>  <!-- Under 2024 -->
</tr>
```

## Solution
The quarter row should ONLY contain quarters, with no cells for the left panel since those are covered by the rowspan.

## Implementation Steps
- ✅ Fix JavaScript header generation (CORRECTED)
- ✅ Remove debugging output  
- ✅ Create test HTML file to verify structure
- ✅ Add temporary debugging to status grid component
- ✅ Test with actual data and browser
- ✅ **ISSUE FOUND AND FIXED**: The CSS file `status-grid.css` was not being imported in `main.css`
- ✅ Added `@import 'components/status-grid.css';` to `main.css`
- ✅ Added `!important` rules to override Bootstrap table styles
- ✅ Verified header alignment is now correct

## Final Cleanup
- ✅ Removed `@import 'components/dhtmlxgantt.css';` from `main.css` (causing 404 error)
- ✅ Updated initiative view header from "Initiative Timeline" to "Initiative Status Grid"
- ✅ Removed duplicate legend HTML (status grid component has built-in legend)
- ✅ Changed icon from `fa-chart-gantt` to `fa-chart-line` to reflect status grid nature
- ✅ Added clarifying comment to API endpoint usage

## Root Cause
The problem was **NOT** in the JavaScript logic - it was in the CSS. The `status-grid.css` file was not being imported in `main.css`, so none of the custom table styles were being applied. This caused the browser to fall back to default table rendering which didn't properly handle the rowspan/colspan structure.

## Resolution
1. Added missing CSS import: `@import 'components/status-grid.css';` in `main.css`
2. Added `!important` rules to override Bootstrap's table styles
3. Added `box-sizing: border-box` for consistent cell sizing
4. Verified the header now displays correctly with proper quarter alignment under years

## Files Created for Testing:
- ✅ `test_header_structure.html` - Visual test to verify correct table structure

## Technical Notes:
The JavaScript code is generating the correct HTML structure:
- Row 1: `<th rowspan="2">Program #</th><th rowspan="2">Program Name</th><th colspan="4">2023</th>...`
- Row 2: `<th>Q1</th><th>Q2</th><th>Q3</th><th>Q4</th>...` (no left panel cells)

This matches the expected structure where quarters align directly under years.

## Status
**✅ COMPLETED** - All dhtmlxGantt references removed, header alignment fixed, CSS properly imported, and UI updated to reflect new status grid component.
