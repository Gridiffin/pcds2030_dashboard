## Fix Edit User Redirect Issue

**Problem:**
The "edit user" functionality redirects to a non-existent page.

**Investigation Steps:**

1.  [ ] Examine `app/views/admin/users/manage_users.php` to find how the "edit user" link or form action is generated.
2.  [ ] Identify the target URL or script for editing a user.
3.  [ ] Check if the target file (e.g., `edit_user.php`) exists in the expected location.
4.  [ ] If the target file exists, check for issues in its path or naming.
5.  [ ] If the action is handled by `manage_users.php` itself (e.g., via a POST request and a `case 'edit_user':` block), inspect the logic within that block, especially any redirects.
6.  [ ] If JavaScript is involved in handling the click, inspect the JavaScript file (`users.js` or `user_table_manager.js`) for URL generation.
7.  [ ] Correct the URL or file path.
