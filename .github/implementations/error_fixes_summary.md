# PCDS2030 Dashboard Error Fixes - Implementation Summary

## Overview
We have successfully fixed all the identified errors in the PCDS2030 Dashboard PHP application:

1. Added the missing functions:
   - `get_agency_sector_metrics()`
   - `get_draft_metric()`
   - `get_all_sectors_programs()`

2. Fixed ROOT_PATH constant issues in multiple files:
   - update_program.php
   - program_details.php
   - delete_program.php

3. Fixed 404 error with delete_program.php by ensuring the file had the correct PROJECT_ROOT_PATH definition

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Function Implementations
We implemented the missing functions by examining the deprecated code as a reference:
- Created a new `metrics.php` file with functions that defer to corresponding outcome functions
- Created a new `outcomes.php` file with the necessary database query logic
- Added the `get_all_sectors_programs()` function to the existing `statistics.php` file

### 2. ROOT_PATH Constant Fix
For each file affected by the ROOT_PATH constant issue, we:
- Added a PROJECT_ROOT_PATH definition at the top of the file
- Updated all require/include statements to use PROJECT_ROOT_PATH instead of ROOT_PATH
- Ensured the definition used the correct directory traversal logic

### 3. Error Verification
We verified all our fixes with PHP's lint command (`php -l`), which confirmed there were no syntax errors in any of the modified files.

## Future Recommendations

1. **Standardize Path Handling**: Consider using a centralized configuration for path definitions to avoid inconsistencies.

2. **Code Deprecation Strategy**: Create a clear migration strategy for deprecated code to avoid functions being referenced from the deprecated codebase.

3. **Function Documentation**: Add proper PHPDoc comments to all functions to clarify their purpose and usage.

4. **Unit Tests**: Implement unit tests for critical functions to catch errors early in the development process.

## Conclusion
All identified errors have been fixed, and the application should now function correctly. The changes were minimal and focused on maintaining compatibility with the existing codebase while addressing the specific issues identified.
