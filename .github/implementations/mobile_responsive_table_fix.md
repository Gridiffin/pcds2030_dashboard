# Mobile-Responsive Table Fix for Current Period Performance

## Problem
The table showing target and status in the "Current Period Performance" section of the view program details page is not responsive and doesn't work well on phone screens. Tables typically have issues on mobile devices due to:
- Fixed column widths causing horizontal scrolling
- Small text that's hard to read
- Poor touch interaction
- Columns getting cramped

## Solution Overview
Implement a mobile-responsive table solution using:
1. CSS responsive table techniques (horizontal scroll, card layout, or stacked layout)
2. Bootstrap responsive utilities
3. Mobile-first design approach
4. Touch-friendly interactions

## Implementation Steps

- Implemented card-based layout for screens ≤768px
- Added proper labels and visual hierarchy for mobile
- Included accessibility features and print styles

### Step 4: Testing and Optimization
