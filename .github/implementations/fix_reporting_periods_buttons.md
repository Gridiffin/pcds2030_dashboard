# Fix Reporting Periods Action Buttons

## Problem
The action buttons (Edit, Delete, Toggle Status) on the admin reporting periods page (`app/views/admin/reporting_periods.php`) are not responsive. No errors or popups appear when clicked.

## Diagnosis
1.  **Edit/Delete Buttons**: The JavaScript (`assets/js/admin/reporting_periods.js`) uses class selectors `.edit-period-btn` and `.delete-period-btn` to attach event listeners. However, the PHP view uses `.edit-period` and `.delete-period` for these buttons. This mismatch prevents the listeners from being attached.
2.  **Toggle Status Button**: The JavaScript for the `.toggle-period-status` button attempts to find an inner element with class `.button-text` to update its text content during AJAX processing. This element does not exist in the button's HTML structure in the PHP view, which will lead to an error when trying to access `textContent` of a null element.

## Solution Steps
- [ ] Correct the JavaScript selectors for Edit and Delete buttons in `assets/js/admin/reporting_periods.js`.
- [ ] Modify the JavaScript for the Toggle Status button in `assets/js/admin/reporting_periods.js` to correctly update the button's content during processing and handle restoration on error.
- [ ] Verify button functionality after changes.
