# Enhanced dhtmlxGantt Project Row Styling

## Problem
The current gantt chart doesn't have clear visual distinction between project rows (programs) and task rows (targets) like the official dhtmlxGantt samples show.

## Solution: Enhanced Project Row Styling
Implement styling that matches dhtmlxGantt's official examples with clear visual hierarchy.

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Enhanced Project Row Styling
- [ ] Add stronger visual distinction for project rows
- [ ] Implement background gradient and border styling
- [ ] Add proper spacing and typography hierarchy
- [ ] Make project rows look like true section headers

### Phase 2: Grid Row Templates
- [ ] Enhance grid_row_class template for better targeting
- [ ] Add CSS classes that match dhtmlxGantt conventions
- [ ] Ensure proper styling inheritance

### Phase 3: Visual Hierarchy
- [ ] Implement proper color scheme for project vs task distinction
- [ ] Add spacing and indentation for child tasks
- [ ] Ensure expand/collapse icons are properly styled

### Phase 4: Testing and Refinement
- [ ] Test visual appearance matches dhtmlxGantt samples
- [ ] Ensure styling works across different browsers
- [ ] Verify accessibility and readability

## Expected Result
Project rows should have clear visual distinction similar to dhtmlxGantt official samples with prominent separator appearance.
