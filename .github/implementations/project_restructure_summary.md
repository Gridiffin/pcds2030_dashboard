# Project Restructuring - Progress Summary

## Completed Tasks in Phase 1

1. ✅ Created directory structure with `app/` subdirectories
2. ✅ Moved files from the original structure to the new structure
3. ✅ Updated configuration in `app/config/config.php` to properly define `ROOT_PATH`
4. ✅ Added `PROJECT_ROOT_PATH` definition to entry point files
5. ✅ Updated include paths in entry point files
6. ✅ Updated include paths in view files
7. ✅ Fixed PowerShell variable syntax in app files
8. ✅ Updated redirection URLs in entry point files
9. ✅ Added helper function `view_url()` for generating consistent view URLs
10. ✅ Updated asset links in `login.php` to use `APP_URL` consistently
11. ✅ Updated redirection in `logout.php` to use absolute URL
12. ✅ Updated redirection in `download.php` to use absolute URL
13. ✅ Created documentation for Phase 2 implementation plan

## Pending Tasks

1. Update all relative URLs in view files to use the `view_url()` function
2. Create helper functions for API and asset URLs
3. Update form actions to use absolute URLs
4. Test the application thoroughly
5. Implement future enhancements:
   - Move UI components to a dedicated directory
   - Implement a more structured autoloading mechanism
   - Further modularize the codebase

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test navigation between different views
2. Test form submissions in admin and agency views
3. Test file downloads and report generation
4. Test AJAX calls and API endpoints
5. Test with different cache settings in browsers

## Next Steps

1. Implement Phase 2 as documented in `project_restructure_phase2.md`
2. Consider implementing a more robust routing system
3. Enhance error handling and logging
4. Add unit tests for critical functionality

The restructuring has maintained the original functionality while improving the organization and maintainability of the codebase.
