# Admin Outcomes Section Overhaul

## Problem
- The admin outcomes management section is inconsistent with the agency side in terms of UI/UX and features for managing outcome details.
- Admin-specific features (resubmit, submit) must be preserved.

## Solution
- Overhaul the admin outcomes management file (`manage_outcomes.php`) to follow the agency side's implementation for listing, editing, and managing outcome details.
- Use `<textarea>` for Description and Label in the edit modal.
- Remove the delete feature for outcome details.
- Integrate admin-only features (resubmit, submit) into the new UI/UX.
- Ensure all related JS and CSS are included and referenced properly.

## Steps
- [ ] Review the current `manage_outcomes.php` implementation.
- [ ] Analyze the agency side's outcomes management for reference.
- [ ] Refactor the admin outcomes section to match the agency side's UI/UX and logic.
- [ ] Integrate admin-specific features (resubmit, submit buttons).
- [ ] Test the new implementation for usability and correctness.
- [ ] Mark this task as complete after verification.
