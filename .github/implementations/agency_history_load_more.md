## Problem
The agency-side "Show History" feature loads all historical changes for a specific field at once. For programs with extensive history, this causes significant performance degradation and a poor user experience by creating very long, unmanageable lists.

## Solution
Refactor the feature to use an AJAX-powered "Load More" button. Initially, only the first 5-10 changes will be shown. Users can click the button to progressively load older batches of changes without a full page refresh.

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Analyze Current Structure ✅
- [x] Review `app/views/agency/programs/update_program.php` to understand how the history is currently rendered within the collapsible sections.
- [x] Identify the existing JavaScript that handles the "Show History" click event and populates the content.
- [x] Examine the `get_program_edit_history()` function in `app/lib/agencies/programs.php` to understand the current data fetching logic.

### Step 2: Create New Backend AJAX Endpoint ✓
- [x] Create a new file: `app/ajax/get_field_history.php`.
- [x] This endpoint will handle `POST` requests and expect `program_id`, `period_id`, `field_name`, and an `offset` parameter.
- [x] It will query the `program_submissions` table, extract the history for only the specified field, and apply `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` for pagination.
- [x] The endpoint must validate user permissions to ensure the user is authorized to view the program's history.
- [x] It will return the data as a JSON response, including the history entries and whether more entries are available.

### Step 3: Modify Frontend View (`update_program.php`) ✓
- [x] Modify the PHP that generates the history view. Instead of embedding all history, it should only embed the *initial* 5 changes.
- [x] Add a placeholder for the "Load More" button within each history container.
- [x] Use `data-*` attributes on the container or button to store necessary info like `data-field-name`, `data-current-offset`, and `data-total-changes`.

### Step 4: Implement Frontend JavaScript ✓
- [x] Create a new JavaScript function to handle the "Load More" click event.
- [x] This function will read the `data-*` attributes to get the context.
- [x] It will display a loading indicator to provide user feedback.
- [x] It will send an AJAX `fetch` request to the new `get_field_history.php` endpoint.
- [x] Upon receiving the JSON response, it will:
    - Render the new history items and append them to the list.
    - Update the `data-current-offset` attribute.
    - Hide the "Load More" button if no more entries are available.
    - Hide the loading indicator.

### Step 5: Testing
- [ ] Test with a field that has no history.
- [ ] Test with a field that has fewer than 3 changes (the "Load More" button should not appear).
- [ ] Test with a field that has more than 3 changes.
- [ ] Test clicking "Load More" multiple times until all history is loaded.
- [ ] Verify that security checks prevent unauthorized access via the AJAX endpoint.

### Step 6: Cleanup ✓
- [x] Ensure all new code is well-documented and follows project coding standards.
- [x] Add CSS styling for the Load More functionality.
- [x] Add loading animations and error handling.

## Implementation Complete!

### Files Created/Modified:
1. **Created**: `app/ajax/get_field_history.php` - AJAX endpoint for paginated field history
2. **Modified**: `app/views/agency/programs/update_program.php` - Added helper functions and updated field history rendering
3. **Modified**: `assets/js/utilities/program-history.js` - Added Load More functionality
4. **Modified**: `assets/css/components/program-history.css` - Added styling for Load More buttons and animations

### Key Features Implemented:
- ✅ Paginated field history with initial 3 items shown
- ✅ "Load More" button with remaining count display
- ✅ AJAX-powered progressive loading
- ✅ Security validation (user permissions)
- ✅ Loading indicators and error handling
- ✅ Smooth animations for new items
- ✅ Proper period-based filtering
- ✅ Support for all field types (text, arrays for targets)

### Ready for Testing:
The feature is now ready for testing with real data. Test scenarios should include fields with varying amounts of history to ensure the Load More functionality works correctly.
