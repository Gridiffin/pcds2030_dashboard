# Fix Delete User Button Path Issue

## Problem Description
The delete user button redirects to a non-existent path:
- **Current (incorrect)**: `http://localhost/pcds2030_dashboard/app/views/handlers/admin/process_user.php?action=delete_user&user_id=44`
- **Expected (correct)**: `http://localhost/pcds2030_dashboard/app/handlers/admin/process_user.php?action=delete_user&user_id=44`

The issue is that the path includes `/views/handlers/` instead of just `/handlers/`.

## Project Structure Analysis
From the workspace structure:
- ✅ **Exists**: `app/handlers/admin/process_user.php`
- ❌ **Does not exist**: `app/views/handlers/admin/process_user.php`

## Root Cause Analysis
Need to identify where the delete user link/button is defined:
- [ ] Check user management pages for delete buttons/links
- [ ] Look for JavaScript that handles delete actions
- [ ] Search for references to the incorrect path
- [ ] Find where the URL is being generated

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Locate the Source of Incorrect Path
- [ ] Search for delete user button/link in user management pages
- [ ] Check manage_users.php or similar files
- [ ] Look for JavaScript delete functions
- [ ] Search for references to `views/handlers`

### Step 2: Fix the Path References
- [ ] Update the incorrect path to remove `/views/` prefix
- [ ] Ensure consistency with other handler references
- [ ] Verify the handler file exists and works correctly

### Step 3: Test the Fix
- [ ] Test the delete user functionality
- [ ] Verify the correct handler is called
- [ ] Ensure proper error handling

### Step 4: Validation
- [ ] Check for any other similar path issues with handlers
- [ ] Ensure all admin handlers use consistent paths
- [ ] Test other user management actions (edit, update, etc.)

## Implementation Notes
- Need to maintain consistency with the project's file structure
- Handlers should be in `/app/handlers/` not `/app/views/handlers/`
- Check if other handler references have the same issue
