# Debug Manage Initiatives Display Issue ✅ COMPLETED

## Problem
The manage initiatives page is not displaying initiatives from the database, even though:
- Database contains initiatives
- No errors in console or PHP logs
- Functions appear to be working

## Investigation Steps
- [x] Check if AJAX request is being made
- [x] Verify AJAX response content
- [x] Test initiative functions directly
- [x] Check if table container is being populated
- [x] Verify database connection in AJAX context
- [x] Fix AJAX filter logic to handle empty is_active values
- [x] Remove pillar_id references from all code
- [x] Fix PHP bind_param() errors in initiative_functions.php
- [x] Clean up all debug/test files

## Fixed Issues
1. **AJAX Filter Logic**: Fixed filter to only apply is_active filter when not empty string
2. **PHP Bind Param Errors**: Fixed all bind_param() calls to use variables instead of expressions
3. **Pillar ID Cleanup**: Removed all references to unused pillar_id field
4. **Admin Login**: Fixed admin password hash issue

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED
All technical issues have been resolved. The initiatives should now display correctly on the manage initiatives page.
