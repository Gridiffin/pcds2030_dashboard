# Feature: Dynamic Program Data Loading by Period

## Goal

When a user selects a period (e.g., Q1), the page should:

- Retrieve the selected `program_id` and `period_id`.
- Display the program's data for that period, allowing editing.
- If fields are unset, show empty fields for user input.

---

## Steps

- [x] **Detect Period Selection Change**

  - Add a JavaScript event listener to the period selector dropdown.

- [ ] **Fetch Program Data for Selected Period**

  - On change, send an AJAX request with `program_id` and `period_id` to a backend endpoint (e.g., `get_period_programs.php` or a new endpoint).
  - The backend returns the program data for that period (or empty/defaults if not set).

- [ ] **Populate Form Fields**

  - On AJAX success, update the form fields with the returned data.
  - If data is missing, leave fields empty for editing.

- [ ] **Fallback/UX**
  - Show a loading indicator while fetching.
  - Handle errors gracefully.

---

## Notes

- Ensure all form fields are updated (program name, targets, remarks, attachments, etc.).
- Use existing backend logic if possible, otherwise create a new endpoint.
- Maintain consistent coding style and reference all related files.
- Update documentation if new files/endpoints are added.
