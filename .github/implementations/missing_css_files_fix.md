# Missing CSS Files Fix

## Problem Description
The application is trying to load CSS files that don't exist, causing 404 errors:
- `assets/css/layout/header.css` - 404 Not Found
- `assets/css/layout/grid.css` - 404 Not Found  
- `assets/css/custom/theme.css` - 404 Not Found

## Root Cause Analysis
These CSS files are being referenced in the header/layout files but the actual files are missing from the project structure.

## Solution Steps

### Phase 1: Investigate Current CSS Structure
- [x] Check current CSS file structure in `assets/css/`
- [x] Find where these missing files are being referenced (in `main.css` import statements)
- [x] Determine what content should be in these files based on existing structure

### Phase 2: Create Missing CSS Files
- [x] Create `assets/css/layout/header.css` with appropriate header styles
- [x] Create `assets/css/layout/grid.css` with grid system styles
- [x] Create `assets/css/custom/theme.css` with theme-specific styles

### Phase 3: Ensure Proper Integration
- [x] Verify files are properly imported in main.css or base.css
- [x] Test that 404 errors are resolved
- [x] Ensure styling remains consistent with existing design

### Phase 4: Follow Project Standards
- [x] Follow the Forest Theme color palette
- [x] Use consistent coding style as per project guidelines
- [x] Ensure modular and maintainable CSS structure

## Implementation Notes
- Based on project instructions, need to ensure all CSS is properly referenced through centralized files
- Must maintain the Forest Theme design system
- Files should be organized following established project structure

## COMPLETED âœ…

### Files Created:
1. **`assets/css/layout/header.css`** - Header layout styles including page headers, breadcrumbs, header actions, and responsive design
2. **`assets/css/layout/grid.css`** - Comprehensive grid system with custom grid utilities, flexbox utilities, gap utilities, and responsive breakpoints
3. **`assets/css/custom/theme.css`** - Forest Theme implementation with color variables, component overrides, and dark mode support

### Verification:
- All CSS files are accessible via HTTP
- Files follow Forest Theme color palette (#537D5D, #73946B, #9EBC8A, #D2D0A0)
- Responsive design implemented
- Dark mode support included
- Consistent with project coding standards

The 404 errors for missing CSS files have been resolved. The application should now load without CSS-related 404 errors.
