# Dashboard Syntax Error Fix

## Problem
The `dashboard.php` file in the admin views folder had syntax errors causing PHP parsing issues. HTML code was incorrectly inserted in the middle of PHP require statements, breaking the file's functionality.

## Analysis
- **Error:** Syntax error at line 11 in `app/views/admin/dashboard.php`
- **Cause:** HTML link code was accidentally inserted within PHP require statements
- **Affected code:**
  ```php
  require_once ROO                            <a href="<?php echo view_url('admin', 'programs.php', ['program_type' => 'assigned']); ?>" class="btn btn-sm btn-success me-2">
                              <i class="fas fa-tasks me-1"></i>View Assigned
                          </a>
                          <a href="<?php echo view_url('admin', 'programs.php', ['program_type' => 'agency']); ?>" class="btn btn-sm btn-info">TH . 'app/lib/session.php';
  ```

## Solution Steps
1. [x] Identify the source of the syntax error in the file
2. [x] Remove the incorrectly inserted HTML code
3. [x] Restore the proper PHP require statements
4. [x] Fix the incorrect path reference (`ROO` instead of `ROOT_PATH`)
5. [x] Verify the file is working properly after the fix

## Implementation
The incorrectly formatted require statements were replaced with their correct form:

```php
// Include necessary files
require_once ROOT_PATH . 'app/config/config.php';
require_once ROOT_PATH . 'app/lib/db_connect.php';
require_once ROOT_PATH . 'app/lib/session.php';
require_once ROOT_PATH . 'app/lib/functions.php';
require_once ROOT_PATH . 'app/lib/admins/index.php';
```

## Prevention
This error was likely caused by accidental copy-paste or merge operation. To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. Use a PHP linter before committing code changes
2. Implement pre-commit hooks to validate PHP syntax
3. Be careful when copying code between different parts of the application
4. Conduct thorough code reviews, especially for files with many includes

## Additional Notes
The HTML links that were incorrectly inserted appear to be part of the dashboard interface, likely meant to be placed in the main content area of the dashboard. These were action buttons for viewing assigned and agency programs. If these buttons are needed in the interface, they should be added in the proper location within the HTML section of the dashboard.
