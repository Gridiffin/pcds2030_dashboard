# Responsive Navbar Text Fix

## Problem
The "PCDS2030 Dashboard Forestry Sector" text in both agency and admin navbars overflows on smaller screens (mobile devices), making it get covered by the screen border and creating horizontal scrolling issues.

## Solution Overview
Make the navbar brand text responsive by:
1. Using CSS media queries to adjust font size and text content based on screen size
2. Implementing text truncation with ellipsis on very small screens
3. Adding flexible text sizing that scales with viewport
4. Using CSS `clamp()` function for smooth scaling
5. Optionally showing abbreviated text on mobile devices

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Update Navigation CSS
- [x] Add responsive typography for navbar-brand
- [x] Implement media queries for different screen sizes
- [x] Add text truncation for very small screens
- [x] Use CSS clamp() for fluid typography

### Step 2: Update Agency Navigation

### Step 3: Update Admin Navigation

## Technical Approach

### CSS Responsive Typography
```css
.navbar-brand {
  font-size: clamp(1rem, 2.5vw, 1.35rem);
  /* Responsive text sizing */
}

@media (max-width: 576px) {
  .navbar-brand {
    font-size: 0.9rem;
    max-width: 70vw;
    overflow: hidden;
    text-overflow: ellipsis;
    white-space: nowrap;
  }
}
```

### Alternative Approach - Content Changes
For very small screens, we could show abbreviated text like:
- "PCDS 2030 Dashboard" instead of full text
- "PCDS Dashboard" for ultra-small screens
