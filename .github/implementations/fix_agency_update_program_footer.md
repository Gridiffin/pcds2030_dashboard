# Fix Agency Update Program Footer and Navigation Issues

## Problem Description
Two issues were identified and resolved:
1. JavaScript reference error for undefined `hasActivePeriod` variable
2. Dropdown navigation links appending "#" to URLs

## Tasks Completed

### ✅ 1. Fixed hasActivePeriod Reference Error
- **Issue**: JavaScript reference error for undefined `hasActivePeriod` variable
- **Solution**: Moved the JavaScript variable definition to after header inclusion
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `app/views/admin/dashboard/dashboard.php`

### ✅ 2. Fixed Dropdown Navigation URLs
- **Issue**: Dropdown navigation links were redirecting to URLs with "#" appended
- **Solution**: Changed dropdown toggle `href="#"` to `href="javascript:void(0)"` to prevent URL modification
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `app/views/layouts/admin_nav.php`

## Implementation Details

### hasActivePeriod Fix
```php
// Before (causing error)
echo "<script>const hasActivePeriod = " . ($hasActivePeriod ? 'true' : 'false') . ";</script>";
require_once '../../layouts/header.php';

// After (fixed)
require_once '../../layouts/header.php';
// ... other includes ...
?>
<script>
const hasActivePeriod = <?php echo $hasActivePeriod ? 'true' : 'false'; ?>;
</script>
```

### Dropdown Navigation Fix
```php
// Before (causing # in URL)
<a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" href="#" id="programsDropdown" ...>

// After (fixed)
<a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" href="javascript:void(0)" id="programsDropdown" ...>
```
