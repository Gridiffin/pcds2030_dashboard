# Audit Log System Implementation

## Overview
Implement a comprehensive audit logging system to track user activities and system events for security and compliance purposes.

## Database Table ✅
- [x] Created `audit_logs` table with proper structure and indexes

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Core Audit Functions ✅
- [x] Create `app/lib/audit_log.php` with logging functions
- [x] Implement `log_audit_action()` function
- [x] Implement `get_audit_logs()` function for retrieval
- [x] Add helper functions for common audit scenarios

### 2. Integration Points ✅
- [x] Add audit logging to login/logout processes ✅
- [x] Add audit logging to CRUD operations (programs, outcomes, users) ✅
- [x] Add audit logging to admin actions ✅
- [x] Add audit logging to data exports/imports ✅
- [x] Add audit logging to permission changes ✅

### 3. Admin Interface Enhancement ✅
- [x] Update existing `audit_log.php` view to use new database structure
- [x] Create AJAX endpoint for loading audit logs
- [x] Implement filtering and pagination
- [x] Add export functionality for audit logs

### 4. JavaScript Components ✅
- [x] Update `admin/audit-log.js` for new functionality
- [x] Add real-time filtering and search
- [x] Implement export features

### 5. Security & Performance ✅
- [x] Ensure sensitive data is not logged
- [x] Add log rotation/archiving strategy
- [x] Test performance impact
- [x] Add proper error handling

### 6. Testing & Documentation ✅
- [x] Test all logging scenarios
- [x] Document audit event types
- [x] Create usage guidelines
- [x] Test export functionality

### 7. Maintenance & Optimization ✅
- [x] Create log maintenance script
- [x] Implement performance testing
- [x] Add comprehensive test suite
- [x] Create operational documentation

## Actions to Track
- User authentication (login/logout success/failure)
- Program creation, updates, deletion
- Outcome submissions and updates
- User management (create, update, delete, role changes)
- Report generation and exports
- System configuration changes
- File uploads/downloads
- Data imports/exports

## Security Considerations
- Never log passwords or sensitive personal data
- Log IP addresses for security analysis
- Ensure audit logs cannot be modified by regular users
- Implement proper access controls for audit log viewing

## Performance Considerations
- Use indexes on frequently queried columns
- Consider archiving old logs
- Batch logging for high-volume operations
- Monitor table size and performance
