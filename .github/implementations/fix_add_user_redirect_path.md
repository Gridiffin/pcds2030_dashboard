# Fix Add User Button Redirect Path Issue

## Problem Description
Clicking the "Add User" button on the add user page redirects to a non-existent path:
- **Current (incorrect)**: `http://localhost/pcds2030_dashboard/app/views/admin/add_user.php`
- **Expected (correct)**: `http://localhost/pcds2030_dashboard/app/views/admin/users/add_user.php`

The issue is that the path is missing the `/users/` subdirectory.

## Root Cause Analysis
Located the source of the incorrect redirect:
- [x] Check form action attribute in add_user.php - **FOUND ISSUE HERE**
- [x] Look for JavaScript redirects - Not applicable
- [x] Search for PHP header redirects - Not applicable  
- [x] Find any links/buttons pointing to the wrong path - Form action was the culprit

**Root Cause**: The form action in `app/views/admin/users/add_user.php` line 98 was using `view_url('admin', 'add_user.php')` instead of `view_url('admin', 'users/add_user.php')`, causing the missing `/users/` subdirectory in the generated URL.

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Locate the Source of Incorrect Redirect
- [x] Search the codebase for references to the incorrect path
- [x] Check form submissions in add_user.php - **FOUND THE ISSUE**
- [x] Look for any navigation links or buttons

### Step 2: Fix the Path References
- [x] Update the incorrect path to include `/users/` subdirectory - **COMPLETED**
- [x] Ensure consistency across all references

### Step 3: Test the Fix
- [x] Verify the add user form submits to the correct path - **COMPLETED**
- [x] Test navigation from other pages - **COMPLETED**
- [x] Ensure no broken links remain - **COMPLETED**

### Step 4: Validation
- [x] Check for any other similar path issues in the admin section - **FOUND SEPARATE ISSUE**
- [x] Ensure the fix doesn't break other functionality - **VALIDATED**

## Additional Issues Found During Validation

While validating the fix, discovered another issue in `app/views/admin/dashboard/dashboard.php`:
- Lines 397 and 450 reference `sector_details.php` without subdirectory path
- However, this file doesn't exist in the codebase at all
- This appears to be a missing feature rather than a path issue
- Recommendation: Create the missing `sector_details.php` file or remove the non-functional links

## Fix Summary

**COMPLETED**: Fixed the main issue where the "Add User" form was redirecting to the wrong path.
- **Changed**: `view_url('admin', 'add_user.php')` 
- **To**: `view_url('admin', 'users/add_user.php')`
- **File**: `app/views/admin/users/add_user.php` line 98
- **Result**: Form now correctly submits to `http://localhost/pcds2030_dashboard/app/views/admin/users/add_user.php`

## Implementation Notes
- This appears to be a simple path correction issue
- Need to maintain consistency with the project's file structure
- Ensure all admin user management paths follow the same pattern
