# Rewrite Status Grid Header Generation

## Problem
The test HTML file shows the correct table structure, but the actual initiatives page is still displaying incorrectly. This suggests there might be an issue in our JavaScript header generation that we missed while making targeted fixes.

## Solution
Completely rewrite the header generation method from scratch, using the working test HTML as a reference.

## Current Issue
Despite our fixes, the actual page shows wrong alignment, suggesting:
- Hidden bugs in the JavaScript generation
- CSS interference 
- Incorrect template rendering

## Implementation Steps
- ✅ Rewrite renderHeader() method completely
- ✅ Use exact same structure as test HTML
- ✅ Add debugging to verify output
- [ ] Test with actual initiative page
- [ ] Remove debugging once confirmed working

## Reference Structure (from working test)
```html
<tr>
  <th rowspan="2">Program #</th>
  <th rowspan="2">Program Name</th>
  <th colspan="4">2023</th>
  <th colspan="4">2024</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <!-- NO cells for left panel -->
  <th>Q1</th><th>Q2</th><th>Q3</th><th>Q4</th>
  <th>Q1</th><th>Q2</th><th>Q3</th><th>Q4</th>
</tr>
```
