# Implementation Plan: Cascading Submission Logic and Enhanced Unsubmit Functionality

## Overview
This implementation addresses the following issues:
1. **Cascading Submission Logic**: When a program is submitted in a new quarter, all previous drafts for the same program should also be finalized (is_draft=0).
2. **Enhanced Unsubmit Functionality**: Ensure the admin-side "unsubmit" function properly reverts submissions to draft, considering the new multi-period logic.

## Objectives
- Implement cascading submission logic to finalize all previous drafts when a new submission is made.
- Update the "unsubmit" function to handle multi-period submissions consistently.
- Test the updated logic with various scenarios (e.g., drafts in non-consecutive quarters, resubmission, etc.).
- Update documentation to reflect the new workflow and logic.

## Tasks

### Cascading Submission Logic âœ…
1. **Update Submission Workflow** âœ…
   - [x] Modified the backend logic in `app/views/agency/ajax/submit_program.php` to:
     - Identify all previous drafts for the same program.
     - Finalize all drafts (set `is_draft=0`) before finalizing the current submission.
   - [x] Ensured proper logging for cascading finalization.

2. **Database Query** âœ…
   - [x] Used parameterized query to update all drafts for the same program with `is_draft=0`.
   - [x] Ensured the query is efficient and handles edge cases (e.g., no previous drafts).

3. **Testing** âœ…
   - [x] Created test file for:
     - Submitting a program with drafts in consecutive quarters.
     - Submitting a program with drafts in non-consecutive quarters.
     - Submitting a program with no previous drafts.

### Enhanced Unsubmit Functionality âœ…
1. **Update Unsubmit Logic** âœ…
   - [x] Created `enhanced_unsubmit_program` function in `app/lib/admins/statistics.php` to:
     - Revert the latest submission for a program to draft.
     - Ensure consistency with the cascading submission logic.
     - Support cascading revert for multi-period scenarios.

2. **Frontend Updates** âœ…
   - [x] Updated the logic in `app/views/admin/programs/unsubmit.php` to:
     - Use the enhanced unsubmit function.
     - Display detailed feedback on affected periods.
     - Support cascade parameter for multi-period unsubmission.

3. **Testing** âœ…
   - [x] Created test cases for:
     - Unsubmitting a program with submissions in consecutive quarters.
     - Unsubmitting a program with submissions in non-consecutive quarters.
     - Unsubmitting a program with only one submission.

### Documentation âœ…
1. **Update Implementation Documentation** âœ…
   - [x] Updated this markdown file to document the cascading submission logic and enhanced unsubmit functionality.
   - [x] Included:
     - Problem description.
     - Step-by-step implementation details.
     - Test cases and expected outcomes.

2. **Update User Documentation** ðŸš§
   - [ ] Update the admin guide to reflect the new submission and unsubmission workflows.

## Expected Outcomes
- **Cascading Submission Logic**: Ensures all drafts are finalized when a new submission is made, preventing incomplete reports.
- **Enhanced Unsubmit Functionality**: Provides a consistent and reliable way to revert submissions to draft.
- **Improved User Experience**: Admins have better control over submissions and can ensure data consistency across periods.

## Implementation Details

### Cascading Submission Logic Implementation

**Problem Solved**: Previously, when a program was submitted in Q4, only Q4 would be marked as submitted (is_draft=0), leaving Q3 as draft (is_draft=1). This caused Q3 to be excluded from half-yearly reports.

**Solution**: When ANY quarter is submitted for a program, ALL other quarters (drafts) for that same program are automatically finalized.

**Code Changes**:
1. **In `app/views/agency/ajax/submit_program.php`**: Added cascading logic that runs before the main submission update:
   ```sql
   UPDATE program_submissions 
   SET is_draft = 0, submission_date = NOW() 
   WHERE program_id = ? AND is_draft = 1 AND period_id != ?
   ```

2. **Logging**: Added audit logging for cascading finalization to track when other quarters are automatically finalized.

**Flow Examples**:
- **Scenario 1**: User submits Q4 after Q3 is already draft
  - System finds Q3 draft for same program
  - System finalizes Q3 (is_draft = 0)
  - System finalizes Q4 (is_draft = 0)
  - Both Q3 and Q4 appear in reports

- **Scenario 2**: User submits Q1 after Q2 is already draft  
  - System finds Q2 draft for same program
  - System finalizes Q2 (is_draft = 0)
  - System finalizes Q1 (is_draft = 0)
  - Both Q1 and Q2 appear in reports

- **Scenario 3**: User submits Q3 after Q1, Q2, Q4 are drafts
  - System finds Q1, Q2, Q4 drafts for same program
  - System finalizes all: Q1, Q2, Q4 (is_draft = 0)
  - System finalizes Q3 (is_draft = 0)
  - All quarters appear in reports

### Enhanced Unsubmit Functionality Implementation

**Problem Solved**: The original unsubmit function only handled single periods and didn't consider the cascading logic implications.

**Solution**: Created `enhanced_unsubmit_program()` function with awareness of multi-period scenarios and optional cascading revert.

**Code Changes**:
1. **In `app/lib/admins/statistics.php`**: Added new `enhanced_unsubmit_program()` function with:
   - Transaction support for consistency
   - Cascading revert option
   - Detailed feedback on affected periods
   - Proper error handling

2. **In `app/views/admin/programs/unsubmit.php`**: Updated to use enhanced function and provide better feedback.

**Features**:
- **Single Period Unsubmit**: Reverts only the specified period to draft
- **Cascading Unsubmit**: Optionally reverts ALL other periods for the same program to draft (not just later periods)
- **Detailed Feedback**: Shows which periods were affected
- **Transaction Safety**: All changes are rolled back if any step fails

### Testing

Created `test_cascading_submission.php` to validate:
1. Current state inspection
2. Enhanced unsubmit functionality
3. State changes after operations
4. Simulation of cascading behavior

**Test Scenarios**:
- Program with drafts in consecutive quarters (Q3, Q4)
- Program with drafts in non-consecutive quarters (Q1, Q3)
- Program with no previous drafts
- Unsubmit with and without cascading

## Status
- [x] Cascading Submission Logic implemented (Updated: ALL quarters, not just previous).
- [x] Enhanced Unsubmit Functionality implemented.
- [x] Documentation updated.
- [x] Testing completed.
- [x] Test files deleted after implementation.
- [x] All syntax checks passed.
- [x] Logic corrected to handle ALL quarters instead of just previous quarters.
- [ ] Changes deployed and validated in production.

## Key Update: ALL Quarters Logic

**Important Change Made**: The initial implementation only finalized previous quarters (period_id < current). This has been **corrected** to finalize ALL other quarters for the same program (period_id != current).

**Why This Change Was Necessary**:
- Half-yearly reports need data from all relevant quarters regardless of submission order
- Users might submit Q1 after Q2, or Q3 after Q4
- The system should ensure ALL quarters are finalized when ANY quarter is submitted
- This guarantees complete data in half-yearly reports

**Updated SQL Logic**:
```sql
-- OLD (incorrect): Only previous quarters
WHERE program_id = ? AND is_draft = 1 AND period_id < ?

-- NEW (correct): All other quarters  
WHERE program_id = ? AND is_draft = 1 AND period_id != ?
```
