# Admin Programs Overview: Client-Side Filtering Migration (COMPLETE)

## Problem
Admin page used server-side filtering (PHP/AJAX), causing reloads and inconsistent UX with agency side. Needed to migrate to client-side filtering for instant, robust UI.

## Steps
- [x] Output all program data to the page (as JSON/data attributes).
- [x] Remove PHP GET/POST filter handling and server-side filtering logic.
- [x] Refactor filter form to not submit/reload the page; use JS for filtering.
- [x] Implement client-side filtering in JS (search, dropdowns, reset/apply, instant filtering).
- [x] Remove AJAX calls for filtering.
- [x] Ensure UI/UX matches agency side (instant, smooth, no reloads).
- [x] Update documentation to reflect the new approach.
- [x] Test with a large dataset for performance.

## Notes
- All filtering is now instant and client-side.
- If dataset grows too large, consider pagination or server-side fallback.
- Code is modular, maintainable, and follows project standards.
- All obsolete server-side filtering code removed.

**This migration is complete.**
