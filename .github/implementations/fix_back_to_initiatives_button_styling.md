## Implementation Summary

### Problem Identified:
The "Back to Initiatives" button was using `btn-outline-primary` class, which would display with blue styling instead of white styling needed for the blue header background.

### Solution Applied:
Changed the button class from `btn-outline-primary` to `btn-outline-light` in the header configuration.

**Before:**
```php
'class' => 'btn-outline-primary',
```

**After:**
```php
'class' => 'btn-outline-light',
```

### Why This Works:
1. **Bootstrap's `btn-outline-light` class** provides exactly what was requested:
   - White text color
   - White border/outline
   - Transparent background
   - White icons automatically

2. **Perfect for Blue Headers**: The `btn-outline-light` class is specifically designed for use on dark or colored backgrounds where white outline buttons provide good contrast.

3. **Built-in States**: Bootstrap's `btn-outline-light` includes proper hover, focus, and active states that maintain white styling with appropriate feedback.

### Changes Made:
- **Modified** `app/views/agency/initiatives/view_initiative.php` line 69
- **Changed** button class in the `$header_config` actions array
- **Leveraged** existing Bootstrap classes (no custom CSS needed)

### Result:
- ✅ Button text is now white
- ✅ Button outline/border is now white  
- ✅ Arrow icon (`fas fa-arrow-left`) is now white
- ✅ Hover and focus states maintain white theme with proper feedback
- ✅ Good contrast against the blue header background
- ✅ Follows Bootstrap design standards

**Status: COMPLETE** - The "Back to Initiatives" button now displays with proper white styling against the blue header background.
