# Fix Duplicate Program Issue in Report Generation

## Problem Analysis
During the implementation of multi-agency report filtering, the logic for handling multiple submission records of the same program may have been affected. The system should:

1. **Preserve multiple submission records** - For change history functionality
2. **Use only the latest submission** - For report generation to avoid duplicates
3. **Identify programs by unique program ID** - Not just by name
4. **Sort by submission date/timestamp** - To get the most recent version

## Current Issue
- Multiple submission records of the same program are appearing in reports
- This creates duplicate slides for the same program
- The system should automatically select the latest submission based on updated date

## Root Cause Analysis
Need to investigate:
- [ ] API endpoint `get_period_programs.php` - does it properly filter to latest submissions?
- [ ] Report slide generation logic - does it handle duplicate program IDs?
- [ ] Database query logic - is it using MAX(submission_date) correctly?
- [ ] Frontend program selection - does it show duplicates?

## Solution Plan

### Phase 1: Database Query Investigation
- [x] Check the current query in `get_period_programs.php`
- [x] Verify that it uses latest submission date logic
- [x] Ensure it groups by program_id properly
- [x] Test the query manually to confirm no duplicates
- [x] **FOUND ISSUE**: Multiple submissions with identical timestamps but different submission_ids

### Phase 2: Fix Database Queries
- [x] Update `get_period_programs.php` to use MAX(submission_id) for tie-breaking
- [x] Update `report_data.php` to use MAX(submission_id) for tie-breaking
- [x] Test queries to ensure only latest submission per program is returned
- [x] Add debug logging to track the improvement
- [x] Verify that queries are efficient and use proper indexing

### Phase 2: Frontend Program Selection Check
- [ ] Verify that program selection shows unique programs only
- [ ] Check if globalProgramSelections handles duplicates correctly
- [ ] Ensure program ordering doesn't create duplicates

### Phase 3: Report Generation Logic
- [ ] Check report slide generation modules
- [ ] Verify that report API processes unique programs only
- [ ] Ensure slide population doesn't create duplicate slides

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
- [ ] Test with programs that have multiple submissions
- [ ] Verify only latest submission appears in reports
- [ ] Confirm change history functionality still works
- [ ] Validate multi-agency selection still works correctly

### Phase 5: Database Schema Validation
- [ ] Confirm program_submissions table structure
- [ ] Verify submission_date and is_draft columns
- [ ] Check for proper indexing on program_id and submission_date

## Expected Outcome
- Reports show only the latest submission for each program
- No duplicate programs in generated slides
- Change history functionality preserved
- Multi-agency selection continues to work
- Database performance optimized for latest submission queries
