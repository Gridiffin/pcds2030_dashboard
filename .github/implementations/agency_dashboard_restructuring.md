# Agency Dashboard Restructuring Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the step-by-step process to restructure the agency views to match the admin side's organized directory structure, starting with the dashboard.

## Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ Current Agency Dashboard Structure
- **Main File**: `/app/views/agency/dashboard.php` - Currently in root agency directory
- **AJAX File**: `/app/views/agency/ajax/dashboard_data.php` - Already in ajax subdirectory
- **Related Files**: Various dashboard-related components scattered in agency root

### üéØ Target Admin Dashboard Structure
- **Main File**: `/app/views/admin/dashboard/dashboard.php` - Organized in dashboard subdirectory
- **AJAX File**: `/app/views/admin/ajax/admin_dashboard_data.php` - In ajax subdirectory

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Dashboard Restructuring

#### üìã Tasks for Dashboard Organization

- [ ] **Task 1.1**: Create `/app/views/agency/dashboard/` directory
- [ ] **Task 1.2**: Move `dashboard.php` to `/app/views/agency/dashboard/dashboard.php`
- [ ] **Task 1.3**: Update all include paths in the moved dashboard file
- [ ] **Task 1.4**: Track and update all redirection paths that reference the dashboard
- [ ] **Task 1.5**: Update navigation references
- [ ] **Task 1.6**: Test dashboard functionality after restructuring

#### üîç Redirection Paths Identified

**Incoming References to Agency Dashboard:**
1. **Navigation Links**:
   - `/app/views/layouts/agency_nav.php` (Line 70, 78) - Navigation brand and dashboard links
   
2. **Index/Entry Points**:
   - `/index.php` (Line 29) - Main entry point redirect
   
3. **Authentication Redirects**:
   - Various files redirect to dashboard after login/actions

**Outgoing References from Dashboard**:
1. **Include Paths** (need to be updated):
   - `../layouts/header.php` ‚Üí `../../layouts/header.php`
   - `../layouts/agency_nav.php` ‚Üí `../../layouts/agency_nav.php`
   - `../layouts/footer.php` ‚Üí `../../layouts/footer.php`

2. **Asset References**:
   - Already using `APP_URL` and `asset_url()` functions - should work fine

3. **AJAX References**:
   - Dashboard uses AJAX calls to `/app/views/agency/ajax/dashboard_data.php` - will need relative path update

#### üõ†Ô∏è File Updates Required

**Files to Update After Moving Dashboard:**

1. **`/app/views/layouts/agency_nav.php`**:
   - Line 70: `href="<?php echo APP_URL; ?>/app/views/agency/dashboard.php"` ‚Üí `dashboard/dashboard.php`
   - Line 78: `href="<?php echo APP_URL; ?>/app/views/agency/dashboard.php"` ‚Üí `dashboard/dashboard.php`

2. **`/index.php`**:
   - Line 29: `$agency_dashboard = APP_URL . '/app/views/agency/dashboard.php';` ‚Üí `dashboard/dashboard.php`

3. **Any authentication/redirect files** that reference the dashboard

4. **Dashboard file itself**:
   - Update all relative include paths
   - Update AJAX endpoint references

### Phase 1 Questions for Clarification

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Do you want to keep a redirect file at the old location (`dashboard.php`) that redirects to the new location (`dashboard/dashboard.php`) for backward compatibility?

2. **AJAX Structure**: Should we also reorganize the AJAX files to match admin structure (move dashboard_data.php to a dashboard-specific ajax folder)?

3. **Testing Approach**: After each file move, do you want to test immediately, or shall we complete the entire dashboard restructuring and then test?

4. **Error Handling**: How should we handle any hardcoded references we might miss? Should we add error logging or user-friendly error messages?

5. **Asset Dependencies**: The dashboard references several CSS/JS files. Should we verify all asset loading works correctly after the move?

## Implementation Decisions ‚úÖ

**Based on user feedback:**
1. ‚ùå No backward compatibility redirect needed
2. ‚úÖ Yes, reorganize AJAX files to match admin structure  
3. ‚úÖ Complete dashboard first, then test, then move to next files
4. ‚úÖ Handle all operations in one batch
5. ‚úÖ Use PROJECT_ROOT_PATH for consistency

## Current Priority

**HIGH PRIORITY PATHS TO TRACK:**
- Navigation menu links (agency_nav.php)
- Main entry point redirects (index.php)  
- Include statements within dashboard.php
- AJAX endpoint references

## Dashboard Restructuring - COMPLETED ‚úÖ

### Files Moved:
- `dashboard.php` ‚Üí `/app/views/agency/dashboard/dashboard.php` ‚úÖ
- `agency_dashboard_data.php` ‚Üí `/app/views/agency/dashboard/ajax/agency_dashboard_data.php` ‚úÖ

### Files Updated:
- `/login.php` - Updated redirect path ‚úÖ
- `/index.php` - Updated redirect path ‚úÖ 
- `/app/views/layouts/agency_nav.php` - Updated navigation links ‚úÖ
- `/assets/js/period_selector.js` - Updated AJAX endpoint path ‚úÖ
- `/app/views/agency/dashboard/ajax/agency_dashboard_data.php` - Fixed include paths ‚úÖ

### Testing Results:
- ‚úÖ PHP syntax validation passed for all files
- ‚úÖ Dashboard loads successfully at new location
- ‚úÖ No errors detected in updated files
- ‚úÖ AJAX file paths corrected and validated
- ‚úÖ Browser access test successful
- ‚úÖ **FIX APPLIED**: Fixed PROJECT_ROOT_PATH for new directory depth

### Cleanup Status:
- üìã Original AJAX file still exists at `/app/ajax/agency_dashboard_data.php` (backup)
- üìã Alternative AJAX file exists at `/app/views/agency/ajax/dashboard_data.php` (needs evaluation)

## Dashboard Status: READY FOR FINAL VERIFICATION

**Dashboard restructuring is complete. All core functionality moved and tested.**
**Awaiting user approval to:**
1. Clean up duplicate/backup files
2. Proceed to next component (programs/outcomes)

1. ‚úÖ Find ALL database redirections related to dashboard
2. ‚è≥ Create the new directory structure
3. ‚è≥ Move dashboard file with updated PROJECT_ROOT_PATH paths
4. ‚è≥ Update all reference files
5. ‚è≥ Document changes for user testing
6. ‚è≥ Move to next component (outcomes/programs)
