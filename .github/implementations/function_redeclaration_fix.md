# Function Redeclaration Error Fix

## Issue
There was a function redeclaration error in the PCDS2030 Dashboard:

```
Fatal error: Cannot redeclare process_content_json() (previously declared in D:\laragon\www\pcds2030_dashboard\app\lib\agencies\programs.php:276) in D:\laragon\www\pcds2030_dashboard\app\lib\agencies\statistics.php on line 29
```

## Problem Analysis
- [x] Identified that both `programs.php` and `statistics.php` defined the same function (`process_content_json`)
- [x] Discovered that `index.php` includes both files, with `programs.php` included first
- [x] Found that the function implementations were similar but not identical

## Solution
- [x] Removed the duplicate `process_content_json` function from `statistics.php`
- [x] Added a comment in `statistics.php` noting that the function is defined in `programs.php`
- [x] Preserved the `has_content_json_schema` function in `statistics.php` which is used by the implementation

## Implementation Details
Edited `statistics.php` to remove the duplicate function definition and added a clarifying comment.

## Testing
The error should now be resolved since there is only one declaration of `process_content_json` in the codebase.

## Future Recommendations
- Consider refactoring these utility functions into a separate helper file
- Add better documentation about function dependencies between files
- Implement namespace usage to avoid function name collisions
