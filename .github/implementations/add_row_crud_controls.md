# Add Edit, Delete, and Order Controls to Row Configuration

## Problem Description
The row configuration section currently only shows edit/delete/move controls when in "Custom" mode, but the user wants these controls to be always available in the row configuration section, similar to how column configuration works.

## Current State
- Row configuration shows edit/delete/move controls only for custom rows
- Column configuration always shows edit/delete/move controls
- Controls are conditionally rendered based on structure type

## Desired State  
- Row configuration should always show edit/delete/move controls
- Controls should work the same way as column configuration
- Consistent UX between row and column management

## Implementation Plan

### ✅ Tasks:

- [x] Update `renderRowsList()` method to always show controls (with conditional enabling)
- [x] Ensure edit/delete/move methods work for all row types
- [x] Update row actions to match column pattern (consistent button styling)
- [x] Make row designer always visible with helpful messaging for preset structures
- [x] Add dynamic titles and help messages based on structure type
- [x] Test all CRUD operations work correctly
- [x] Update documentation

### Files to Modify:
- `assets/js/table-structure-designer.js`
  - `renderRowsList()` method: Remove conditional controls, always show them
  - Ensure consistent button styling and behavior

### Implementation Notes:
- Keep the same button structure as columns but adapt for vertical movement (up/down instead of left/right)
- Maintain existing functionality while improving UX consistency
- All existing CRUD methods (`editRow`, `removeRow`, `moveRowUp`, `moveRowDown`) are already implemented

## Expected Result:
Row configuration will have the same user-friendly interface as column configuration, with always-visible edit, delete, and reorder controls.

## ✅ COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Enhanced Row List Display (`renderRowsList`)**:
   - Always shows edit, delete, and move controls for all rows
   - Controls are enabled for custom mode, disabled for preset mode
   - Consistent button styling matching column configuration
   - Added tooltips for better UX

2. **Improved Row Designer Visibility**:
   - Row designer now always visible (not hidden for preset structures)
   - Dynamic title shows current structure type
   - Help message explains preset vs custom behavior
   - Add form disabled for preset structures with clear messaging

3. **Better User Experience**:
   - Users can see what rows exist in preset structures
   - Clear visual feedback about enabled/disabled state
   - Consistent interface between row and column configuration
   - Helpful guidance for switching between modes

### New Behavior:

| Structure Type | Row List | Edit/Delete/Move | Add Form | Help Message |
|---------------|----------|------------------|----------|--------------|
| Monthly       | ✅ Visible | 🔒 Disabled | 🔒 Disabled | ✅ Shown |
| Quarterly     | ✅ Visible | 🔒 Disabled | 🔒 Disabled | ✅ Shown |
| Yearly        | ✅ Visible | 🔒 Disabled | 🔒 Disabled | ✅ Shown |
| Custom        | ✅ Visible | ✅ Enabled | ✅ Enabled | ❌ Hidden |

### Files Modified:
- `assets/js/table-structure-designer.js`
  - `renderRowsList()`: Always show controls, conditional enabling
  - `renderRowDesigner()`: Added help message area and dynamic title
  - `updateRowDesignerVisibility()`: Enhanced with title updates and help message control

The implementation provides a consistent and intuitive interface that matches the column configuration pattern while maintaining the distinction between preset and custom structures.
