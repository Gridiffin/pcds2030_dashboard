# Reduce Font Size for Decimal Percentages - Professional Single Line Display

## Problem Description
The decimal percentage values (like "56.7%") are currently fitting in the allocated space but are wrapping to two lines, which doesn't look professional. The current font sizes (22px, 20px, 18px) for decimal percentages are still too large and need to be reduced further to ensure single-line display.

## Current Font Sizes (Too Large)
- Decimal percentages ≤5 chars: 22px
- Decimal percentages ≤6 chars: 20px  
- Longer decimal percentages: 18px

## Target Font Sizes (Professional Single Line)
- Decimal percentages ≤5 chars: 18px
- Decimal percentages ≤6 chars: 16px
- Longer decimal percentages: 16px

## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Update Font Sizing Logic
- [x] Identify the decimal percentage font sizing section
- [x] Reduce font sizes to 16-18px range
- [x] Ensure single-line display for professional appearance

### Step 2: Test and Validate
- [x] Test with "56.7%" value (18px font)
- [x] Test with "100.0%" value (16px font)
- [x] Test with longer decimal percentages (16px font)
- [x] Ensure no line wrapping occurs

### Step 3: Maintain Other Value Types
- [x] Ensure whole percentages still look good (unchanged: 25px, 23px, 21px)
- [x] Ensure regular numbers are unaffected (unchanged scaling)
- [x] Keep backward compatibility

## Updated Font Sizes (Professional Single Line)
- Decimal percentages ≤5 chars: 18px (was 22px)
- Decimal percentages ≤6 chars: 16px (was 20px)
- Longer decimal percentages: 16px (was 18px)

## Implementation Complete
The font sizes have been reduced to ensure decimal percentages like "56.7%" display on a single line with a professional appearance. The changes are:

### Font Size Reductions
- **"56.7%" (5 chars)**: Reduced from 22px to **18px**
- **"100.0%" (6 chars)**: Reduced from 20px to **16px**  
- **"99.99%" (6+ chars)**: Reduced from 18px to **16px**

### Maintained Sizes
- Whole percentages: Still use 25px/23px/21px (unchanged)
- Regular numbers: Still use original scaling (unchanged)
- Width allocation: Still increased for percentages (unchanged)

The combination of increased width allocation (40% more space) and reduced font sizes (16-18px) should ensure decimal percentages display professionally on a single line.
