# Missing get_sector_name() Function Fix

## Problem Description
The application is experiencing a fatal error in the agency dashboard due to an undefined function:
```
Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Call to undefined function get_sector_name() in D:\laragon\www\pcds2030_dashboard\app\views\agency\dashboard.php:39
```

This error occurs because the `get_sector_name()` function is missing from the current application structure. The function was previously defined in the deprecated project structure but wasn't migrated to the new structure.

## Solution Steps

- [x] Check dashboard.php to understand how the get_sector_name() function is used
- [x] Search the codebase for existing implementations of get_sector_name()
- [x] Found the function in deprecated/includes/agencies/statistics.php 
- [x] Create the app/lib/agencies/statistics.php file with the get_sector_name() function
- [x] Include additional related functions (get_all_sectors) for a complete implementation
- [x] Update the app/lib/agencies/index.php file to include the statistics.php file

## Implementation Details

1. Created app/lib/agencies/statistics.php with:
   - get_sector_name() function to retrieve the sector name by ID
   - get_all_sectors() function to retrieve a list of all sectors
   - Proper error handling and documentation

2. Updated app/lib/agencies/index.php to:
   - Include the new statistics.php file
   - Keep the commented placeholders for potential future files

## Testing

The fix should:
- Allow the agency dashboard to load without errors
- Properly display sector names in the dashboard
- Maintain consistency with the database schema and application structure
