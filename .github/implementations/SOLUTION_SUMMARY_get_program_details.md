# PCDS2030 Dashboard - get_program_details() Function Implementation Summary

## Issue Resolution: COMPLETED ✅

### Problem Description
The `get_program_details()` function was undefined and being called in multiple agency view files, causing fatal errors when agencies tried to access program details, update programs, or submit program data.

### Root Cause
The function `get_program_details()` was referenced in agency views but never actually implemented. The system had a similar function `get_admin_program_details()` for admin use, but no equivalent for agency use.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. Function Implementation
- **Location**: `app/lib/agencies/programs.php`
- **Function Signature**: `get_program_details($program_id, $allow_cross_agency = false)`
- **Based On**: `get_admin_program_details()` from `app/lib/admins/statistics.php`

#### 2. Key Features Added
- **Access Control**: Agency users can only view their own programs unless explicitly allowed
- **Cross-Agency Viewing**: Optional parameter to allow viewing programs from other agencies (used by all_sectors view)
- **Input Validation**: Proper sanitization and validation of program_id parameter
- **Security**: Parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- **Data Structure**: Compatible return format matching existing code expectations

#### 3. Files Fixed
- ✅ `app/views/agency/update_program.php` (line 38)
- ✅ `app/views/agency/program_details.php` (line 42)
- ✅ `app/views/agency/submit_program_data.php` (line 120)

#### 4. Verification Completed
- ✅ No PHP syntax errors in any affected files
- ✅ Function properly included via existing `app/lib/agencies/index.php`
- ✅ Compatible with existing code patterns and usage
- ✅ Function signature and parameters validated
- ✅ All originally failing function calls now have a working implementation

### Function Details

```php
/**
 * Get detailed information about a specific program for agency view
 * Based on get_admin_program_details but with agency-specific access controls
 * 
 * @param int $program_id The ID of the program to retrieve
 * @param bool $allow_cross_agency Whether to allow viewing programs from other agencies (default: false)
 * @return array|false Program details array or false if not found/unauthorized
 */
function get_program_details($program_id, $allow_cross_agency = false)
```

### Security Features
- Validates user is an agency before proceeding
- Enforces program ownership unless cross-agency viewing is explicitly allowed
- Uses parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Proper input validation and type checking

### Returned Data Structure
The function returns a comprehensive array containing:
- Program basic information (name, description, dates, etc.)
- Agency and sector details
- Complete submissions history with reporting periods
- Parsed JSON content including targets, achievements, remarks, and status
- Current submission data (most recent)

### Testing Results
All validation tests passed:
- ✅ Function exists and is callable
- ✅ Proper parameter structure (required program_id, optional allow_cross_agency)
- ✅ No syntax errors in implementation or calling files
- ✅ Compatible with existing include structure

### Impact
This fix resolves the critical error that was preventing agencies from:
- Updating their programs
- Viewing program details
- Submitting program data

The implementation maintains full compatibility with existing code while adding proper security controls for agency access.
