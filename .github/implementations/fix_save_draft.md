# Fix Save Draft Functionality

## Problem
When users change any field and click "Save Draft", the page refreshes and redirects back to the edit programs page without saving changes. No error indication is shown.

## Potential Causes
1. Form submission issues (missing form action, method problems)
2. Server-side validation errors not being displayed
3. Database connection issues during save
4. Session/authentication problems
5. Missing or incorrect form field names
6. JavaScript preventing form submission
7. Server-side redirect happening before save completes

## Investigation Steps
- [x] Check form structure (action, method, field names) - FORM IS CORRECT
- [x] Review server-side form processing logic - LOGIC IS WORKING
- [x] Check for JavaScript form validation/prevention - NO ISSUES FOUND
- [x] Verify database save operations - SAVES ARE WORKING
- [x] Check error handling and display - **ISSUE FOUND**: Errors not displayed
- [x] Test session and authentication - NO ISSUES
- [x] Review redirect logic - **ISSUE FOUND**: Success redirects away from form

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Error messages not displayed**: Form processing errors were stored in local `$message` variables but never displayed to the user
2. **Inconsistent error handling**: Some errors use session messages + redirect, others use local variables
3. **Success redirect confusion**: User expects to stay on edit page to see changes, but success redirects to programs list

## Fixes Applied ✅

### 1. Added Error Message Display
- Added proper alert display for error/success messages from session
- Messages now appear at top of form with dismiss button
- Automatically clears session messages after display

### 2. Made Error Handling Consistent
- Changed local `$message` variable errors to use session messages + redirect
- All errors now follow same pattern: set session message → redirect → display → clear

### 3. Fixed Success Redirect Behavior  
- Changed success redirect from `view_programs.php` to stay on edit page
- Users now see success message and can verify their changes were saved
- Maintains context and reduces confusion

### 4. Fixed Target Number Validation Bug
**Problem**: Target validation incorrectly triggered when editing unrelated fields
**Root Cause**: Validation checked ALL targets, including existing unchanged ones
**Solution**: Load existing target numbers first, skip database validation for unchanged targets
**Result**: Users can edit any field without false validation errors

### 5. Technical Changes Made
- **Added message display code** after page header include
- **Fixed error handling** in form processing catch block
- **Updated redirect logic** for successful saves
- **Added period_id** to success redirect URL to maintain context
- **Improved target validation logic** to prevent false positives

## Files Modified
- `app/views/agency/programs/update_program.php` - Fixed error display and redirect logic

## Expected Behavior Now
1. **Save Draft Success**: User stays on edit page, sees green success message, form shows saved values
2. **Save Draft Error**: User stays on edit page, sees red error message with specific details
3. **Validation Errors**: User sees red error message explaining what needs to be fixed

## Ready for Testing ✅
The save draft functionality should now work correctly with proper user feedback!
