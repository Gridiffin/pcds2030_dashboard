# Replace dhtmlxGantt with Custom Status Grid

## Problem
We've been trying to force dhtmlxGantt to display a status grid, but the original chart is NOT a Gantt chart at all. It's a simple status matrix showing:
- Programs (bold header rows)
- Targets (regular rows) 
- Quarter columns with status indicators
- No timeline bars - just colored status squares/circles

## Solution: Build Custom Status Grid
Replace dhtmlxGantt entirely with a simple, clean HTML table/CSS Grid solution.

### Phase 2: Create Custom Status Grid Component
- [ ] Create new JavaScript class for status grid
- [ ] Use HTML table or CSS Grid for layout
- [ ] Implement scrollable left panel
- [ ] Add responsive design

### Phase 3: Status Grid Layout
- [ ] Programs as bold separator rows
- [ ] Targets as regular rows with indentation
- [ ] Quarter columns with proper headers
- [ ] Status indicators (colored circles/squares)

### Phase 4: Styling and Interactions
- [ ] Match original design exactly
- [ ] Add hover effects
- [ ] Implement proper scrolling
- [ ] Add status legend

### Phase 5: Data Integration
- [ ] Update API calls to work with new component
- [ ] Transform data for simple table format
- [ ] Add loading and error states

## Benefits of Custom Solution
- ✅ **Much simpler** - no complex Gantt library
- ✅ **Exact match** - can replicate original design perfectly
- ✅ **Lightweight** - just HTML/CSS/JS
- ✅ **Maintainable** - easy to understand and modify
- ✅ **Responsive** - easier to make mobile-friendly
