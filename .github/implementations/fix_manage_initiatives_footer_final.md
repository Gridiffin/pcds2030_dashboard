# Fix Manage Initiatives Footer Positioning - Final Implementation

## Overview
Final fix for the footer positioning issue in the manage initiatives page where the footer was appearing in the middle of the page when there were no initiatives to display.

## Problem
- Footer was appearing right after the "No initiatives found" section instead of being pushed to the bottom
- The page wasn't using proper flexbox layout to fill the available height
- The main content area and card containers weren't properly structured for flexbox layout

## Solution
Applied comprehensive flexbox layout fixes to ensure the footer is always at the bottom:

### 1. Main Content Container
```php
<main class="flex-fill d-flex flex-column" style="min-height: calc(100vh - 200px);">
```

### 2. Initiatives Table Container
```php
<div id="initiativesTableContainer" class="flex-fill" style="min-height: 400px;">
```

### 3. Card Container (AJAX Response)
```php
<div class="card shadow-sm h-100 d-flex flex-column">
```

### 4. Card Body
```php
<div class="card-body p-0 flex-fill d-flex flex-column">
```

### 5. Empty State Container
```php
<div class="text-center py-5 flex-fill d-flex flex-column justify-content-center" style="min-height: 60vh;">
```

## Key Changes
1. **Main container**: Added `d-flex flex-column` and changed min-height to `calc(100vh - 200px)`
2. **Table container**: Added `flex-fill` class to expand and fill available space
3. **Card container**: Added `h-100 d-flex flex-column` for proper height and flexbox
4. **Card body**: Added `flex-fill d-flex flex-column` to expand vertically
5. **Empty state**: Added `flex-fill d-flex flex-column justify-content-center` with `min-height: 60vh`

## Result
- Footer is now properly positioned at the bottom of the page in all scenarios
- When there are no initiatives, the "No initiatives found" section takes up the remaining space and centers its content
- When there are initiatives, the table displays normally with footer at bottom
- Layout is consistent with other admin pages using the Modern Footer design

## Files Modified
- `app/views/admin/initiatives/manage_initiatives.php`

## Testing
- ✅ Page loads without PHP errors
- ✅ Footer appears at bottom when no initiatives exist
- ✅ Footer appears at bottom when initiatives are present
- ✅ Layout is responsive and matches other admin pages
- ✅ AJAX loading works correctly with proper layout
