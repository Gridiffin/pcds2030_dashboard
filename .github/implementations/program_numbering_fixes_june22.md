# Program Numbering Fixes - June 22, 2025

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Program Creation Still Required Dates
**Problem**: Start date and end date fields were marked as required in the program creation form.

**Fix Applied**:
- Removed `required` attribute from both `start_date` and `end_date` input fields
- Removed red asterisks (*) from field labels
- Added helpful form text explaining dates are optional
- Updated in: `app/views/agency/programs/create_program.php` lines 275-295

### ✅ Issue 2: No Program Number Display in Overview Steps
**Problem**: Program number wasn't shown in the review/overview step of program creation.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added program number review section in the overview step HTML
- Updated JavaScript `updateReviewSummary()` function to populate program number
- Shows "Not specified" when no program number is provided
- Updated in: `app/views/agency/programs/create_program.php` lines 396-403 and 686-688

### ✅ Issue 3: No Program Number Editing in Update Program Page
**Problem**: Program number field was processed in PHP but the HTML form field was missing.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added complete program number input field to the update form
- Includes pattern validation and helpful form text
- Field uses existing value from database or shows empty if null
- Updated in: `app/views/agency/programs/update_program.php` lines 746-757

## Validation Summary

### Date Fields Now Optional
- ✅ Start date and end date are now optional in program creation
- ✅ Date consistency validation still works (end date must be after start date if both provided)
- ✅ Programs can be created without any timeline information

### Program Number Functionality
- ✅ Program numbers display in all views as blue info badges
- ✅ Search works for both program names and numbers
- ✅ Validation ensures only numbers and dots are allowed
- ✅ Field is optional - programs work fine without numbers
- ✅ Can be edited in update program form

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ Existing programs without dates continue to work
- ✅ Existing programs without program numbers display correctly
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Create New Program**:
   - Try creating a program with program number (e.g., "31.1")
   - Try creating a program without dates
   - Try creating a program with both number and dates
   - Verify overview step shows all information correctly

2. **Edit Existing Program**:
   - Open an existing program in edit mode
   - Add a program number to an existing program
   - Verify program number is saved and displayed

3. **Search Functionality**:
   - Search for programs by name
   - Search for programs by number
   - Verify results show program number badges

4. **Admin Views**:
   - Check admin program listings show program numbers
   - Test program assignment with program numbers
   - Verify admin search includes program numbers

## Files Modified
